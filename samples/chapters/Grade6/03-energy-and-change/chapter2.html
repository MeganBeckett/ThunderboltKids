        <p>We can say that a material or object conducts electricity or it does not. But what does this mean? Let's do an investigation to find out. To do this we are going to use a simple circuit. We will connect pieces of different materials into a closed circuit with a light bulb in it. We can easily see if the material is a conductor.</p>

            <p>One cannot investigate materials with low but significant conductance such as salt water. Later there is reference to shocking and the dangers involved. The reason we get shocked is because we are pretty good conductors. This is mostly due to the fact that our bodies have a fair amount of salt in solution. Also, pure water is a very poor conductor and poses much less of a shock risk. In this investigation, some substances, such as salt water, cannot be tested (unless many batteries are connected in series to the test circuit).</p>

        <h2 class="title">Good electrical conductors and insulators</h2>
        <section class="maincontent span10"><p>
          A good electrical conductor is a material or substance that allows an electrical current to pass through it easily. We call the ability to conduct <em>conductivity</em>. Electrical conductors are usually metal because metals generally have high conductivity. Copper is one of the best electrical conductors and this is why it is the most common material used for electrical wiring. Gold and silver are even better conductors than copper, but they are very expensive and only used sometimes.
        </p>
        
        <p>Insulators are non-conducting materials that do not easily allow current to pass through them. This does not mean that current can not pass through them at all. For example, we generally consider air an insulator, however, lightning can cause electric current to pass through air. Similarly, rubber gloves and shoes will protect you from mains electric current, but not from lightning. Examples of insulators are plastic, rubber, and wood.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>When two conducting materials make contact, electricity can pass through them. Our bodies are also good conductors of electricity. This means electric current can easily flow through you and into the Earth, giving you a shock. That is why we cover conducting wire with insulating materials (like the plastic around extension cords). We want to protect ourselves from being shocked, and prevent the electrical current from passing to other conductors.</p>

          <h3 class="title">The importance of electrical insulators</h3>
          <section class="maincontent span10"><p/>
          
          <p>Think of the electric wires that you use in class for the activities. Why do you think they are covered in plastic? The plastic is an insulator and therefore prevents you from getting a shock. The plastic coating acts as a barrier that prevents you from getting a shock, allowing you to handle the wire when the circuit is on.</p>
          
          <p>Electrical insulators are also used in other places. Have you ever looked up at power lines or telephone lines? You will see that the poles that carry the lines are sometimes made of wood. Wood does not conduct electricity so the electric current can therefore not get from the wires into the pole.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Sometimes you will also see little white or coloured caps holding the wires as in the photo below. These caps are made of ceramic which also does not conduct electricity.</p>

          <p>Sometimes, it is especially important to have ceramic electrical insulators between two different metal conductors to prevent electric current from flowing between the different parts such as in the photo below.</p>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0049.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0049.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">Can you see the dark red-brown ceramic electrical insulators?</figcaption></figure><p/>

            <p>You can also point out the electric rings in the photo which are also electrical insulators and a further precaution.</p>

            <p>Do you remember naming the different parts in a bulb? Look at the picture of a bulb again below and explain why you think the piece separating the electric metal pins (conductors) is made of glass.</p>

            <hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>The glass is an insulator and therefore prevents electric current from flowing through the bottom of the electric pins and not through the coil at the top. With the glass insulation, the electric current rather flows through the coil at the top which then heats up and produces light.</p>

          <p>Electricians are people whose job it is to work with electricity and fix the wiring in houses and other buildings. Electricians often wear rubber gloves to protect themselves from getting a shock. Rubber is an electrical insulator.</p>

                  <p>Suppose you have found a piece of material. You are not sure what the material is. You want to find out if it is a good conductor or a good insulator.

                  <p>Set up an electric circuit as was done in the investigation with a battery, a bulb, and electric wires. Two ends of the wire must be unconnected so it is an open circuit. Test the object/material by placing it between the two ends of the wires to complete the circuit. If the material is an electrical conductor then the bulb will light up.</p>

                  <p>A metal such as copper is used to make the inside of the wire as copper conducts electricity. The copper wire is covered in a material such as plastic which is an insulator to protect people handling the wire and also prevent the wire from making an electrical connection with other metal objects.</p>

                  <p>He is wearing gloves made of material and rubber as they are electrical insulators and therefore protect him from getting an electric shock when handling electrical wires and appliances. The thick soles on his shoes also prevent an electric current from passing through him and into the Earth.</p>
