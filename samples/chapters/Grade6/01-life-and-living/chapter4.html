          <strong>Introducing this topic</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>This topic forms part of Food Science which is an exciting branch of Science that incorporates Chemistry, Biology and Physics with real-world applications.</p>
        
        <p>Remind students that this term's work has focused on how food is made through photosynthesis and the important role that plants play in this process. We then moved on to investigate nutrition and the importance of a balanced diet before looking at the diseases and health problems associated with a poor diet. In this chapter we'll look at food processing and how humans have devised ways to keep food healthier for longer.</p>

          People have been processing food for thousands of years. Before the invention of fridges and freezers, people had to collect food in summer and store it because in winter food is often scarce. They found out that they could preserve food like meat and fish by salting and spicing, and then drying it - this is called <strong>curing</strong> the meat. In South Africa <strong>biltong</strong> and <strong>bokkoms</strong> are examples of cured meat and fish.

It is late summer and you need to spend a year wherever you are and survive until the wormhole opens again at that exact spot and allows you to return to 'the future'.</p>
          
          <p>Your mission: gather as much information on the local inhabitants and the food they eat, their ways of living and how they survive the elements and natural dangers in their environment. When you return you will need to explain how they preserved and processed different foods to last them through winter and how they packaged and protected this food from scavenging animals and pesky insects.</p>
          
          <p>Brainstorm this problem with your group. List as many different questions or problems that you can think of that will affect you:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>immediately,</li>
            <li>in about a month's time,</li>
            <li>in 6 month's time, and</li>
            <li>right at the end of your stay - a week or so before you return to the present time.</li>
          </ul><p>Think especially of food and shelter, and specifically how you will collect, preserve and process any food that you collect. Remember you are not allowed to take anything that is not organic so no pocket knives, nylon rope or even lighters can go with you!</p>
          
          <p>Design the following items that you can make and use when you land.</p>
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Something that you can collect and carry water in, and store it for 'the future'.</li>
            <li>Something that you can collect and carry food in, and specifically something that you need to store it in to keep it away from scavenging animals and insects.</li>
            <li>Something that you can use to cut with - you will need to make a shelter to sleep in and keep safe from wild animals; and also cut material for your food and water containers.</li>
            <li>Something that you can use to hunt animals or catch fish if you are going to eat meat while you are there.</li>
            <li>A device that you can use to preserve meat or fish, or perhaps fruit and vegetables for the winter months.</li>
          </ol><p>Give each person in your group one of these items to make and bring to class. Make sure you do not use any modern tools or any metal, glass or plastic as it is highly unlikely that you would have any such items to use 250 years ago.</p>

            <strong>Introducing this lesson:</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Start this lesson by brainstorming different types of processed foods and facilitating discussion to try and agree on a class definition for 'processed food'. It should be clear after this discussion that:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Almost all the food we eat is processed in one way or another.</li>
            <li>Food and beverage companies change raw animal and plant products into food that we can eat or drink through various processes. This is called food processing.</li>
            <li>Food processing can include: cooking, baking, roasting, grilling, smoking, drying, spray drying, juice concentrating, freezing, milling (wheat), and sometimes slaughtering animals for their meat is also considered a form of food processing.</li>
            <li>We process food to make it more edible (preparing / cooking), last longer (preserving) and to increase the nutritional value (fermenting).</li>
          </ul><p>Make a class list of possible reasons WHY food is processed and possible examples of people who would benefit from this processing - write this on newsprint or poster paper to refer and add to as you go.</p>

          <h3 class="title">Food Processing - Then and Now</h3>
          <section class="maincontent span10"><p>Hundreds of years ago explorers like Columbus, Da Gama and Diaz, had to pack supplies for their crews to last a very long time should they not find food and water on their expeditions. They too had to take as much preserved food and drink as they could.</p>
          
          <p>Many of the foods we eat today cannot be eaten in their raw form - we need to process the food to make it edible.</p>
          
          <p>Sometimes food is also processed to add to its nutritional value, for example when we ferment dairy products to make yogurt, cheese and buttermilk.</p>

          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Transportation of fresh food is quite difficult. If producers can process the fresh fruit and vegetables in some way, the food is easier to transport. Delicate products like grapes, strawberries and peaches can be transported much more easily when they are preserved than if they were fresh. The processing also helps the fruit and vegetables to last longer.</li>

Therefore, food processing and transportation makes the modern 'balanced' and varied diet possible.</li>
            <li>Many times food and beverage producers add extra vitamins and nutrients to their food to make it healthier for their clients.</li>
            <li>Buying and preparing processed food is also more convenient and less time-consuming.</li>
            <li>Foods are processed to preserve them, for example when fruits are preserved to make jam, or pickled (eg. pickled onions).</li>

              <li>You must take notes in the space below.</li>
            </ol><div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>
                <strong>Class discussion</strong>: Discuss the results of their homework surveys with the class and make a mindmap on the board showing the possible reasons why people do or don't think processed food is good for you.
              </p>
              
              <p>The following information must be used to facilitate the class discussion. Make sure to write the main points on the board so that learners can copy the main headings down. Also encourage learners to take down some additional notes. This is an important skill for their school career.</p>
              
              <p>There are different ways to process food, but in almost all of these ways some of the nutrients, vitamins and minerals are destroyed. Any process that uses heat generally also destroys Vitamin C, for example. However, people tend to think that here is very little nutrients left in processed food when this is actually not the case. Research has shown that only between \(\text{5}\)% - \(\text{20}\)% of nutrients are lost when food is processed - in a factory or a home. The amount of nutrient loss depends on the method used to process the food.</p>
              
              <p>You might have heard that there are dangerous additives in processed food that make it very bad for you. In the past many food manufacturers have in fact added many extra products to food:</p>
              <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
                  <strong>Preservatives</strong>: preservatives, such as sulfur dioxide,  are added to food to make it last longer. These are not always very healthy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Colourings</strong>: Many food and beverage manufacturers used to add all sorts of artificial colourings to food to make it look more attractive to their consumers - a bit like adding paint to your food! Nowadays, with many consumers complaining, they no longer do this but only add natural colourants that can be made from berries or plants for example.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Artificial sweeteners, salt and flavourings:</strong> Manufacturers also used to add artificial sweeteners and flavourings, such as MSG (monosodium glutamate), that are cheaper and allow them to make a larger profit. Artificial flavourings are not very healthy and can cause organ and brain damage. Many people are also allergic to these products. Therefore, many companies have stopped adding artificial sweeteners, salt and flavourings and have instead chosen to add natural products instead.
                </li>
                <li>Governments around the world have drawn up very strict laws that control the additives that get added to food and beverages, and food manufacturers have to be incredibly careful what they add nowadays. Only additives that have been proven to be safe for humans to eat or drink may be added to food.</li>

          </p>
          
          <p>The CAPS require that learners research different ways of processing food (raw material) and then choose one way and process food (raw material) using this method. We have set this out as a project that teachers can use to assess. The unit briefly introduces some of the ways of processing food and very briefly touches on each of these. Learners are then required to research their preferred method and present their research using various methods, like posters / slideshows in PowerPoint / etc - about this method of food processing. They also need to process food (raw material) using this method and demonstrate the steps they followed to their class.</p>
        </div>
        <p>There are different levels of food processing. The key question is to ask: has any process occurred from when this plant or animal was in its natural habitat to where it is now? If you can say yes then you know that it has been processed in some way or another.</p>

          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Below are guidelines to facilitate the discussion and answers.</p>
            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Hygiene - it is very easy for germs and bacteria to start growing in food. Therefore, manufacturers have to take every possible precaution to ensure that every utensil, mixer, piece of equipment and specifically the workers' hands and clothing is sterile and remains that way.</li>
              <li>Energy efficient - the extremely high cost of energy sources such as electricity, oil or diesel, makes it vital that food production uses the smallest amount of energy to 'get the job done safely'. The more money that needs to be spent on energy the smaller the profit for the company will be.</li>
              <li>minimal wastage - manufacturers make every effort to cut down as much as possible on any and all waste. The more waste there is the less profit they make and the more they have to spend on removing and 'getting rid' of the waste.</li>
              <li>Labour (measured as the number of working hours per ton of finished product) - manufacturers try to cut down on the amount of people that handle any given food product because that increases the cost to the company. Labour in certain countries costs more than in others which also pushes up the price of the goods.</li>
              <li>Minimal factory shutdowns - each time the factory or operation gets shut down to clean it the factory is not making money. Manufacturers therefore try to keep every small part of their production line as clean and 'maintenance' free as possible. They even try to invent machines that are self-cleaning!</li>

              <strong>Zulu beer making</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Beer (<em>utshwala</em>) forms an integral part in the Zulu culture, especially at social gatherings and traditional ceremonies. Zulu beer is traditionally made by the women. To brew the beer, the women soak coarse sorghum and maize in water for one day, typically in a big drum-like <em>imbiza</em> pot. The following day, the broth is boiled over a fire and more dry sorghum is added to the mixture. After this, the mixture is mashed together and then allowed to cool for the rest of the day. The next day (day 3 of the brewing process), the mixture is filtered through a sieve to remove the big fibres. The sieve is made from palm fronds and the brew is poured from the big <em>imbiza</em> vessel into the serving vessel, <em>iphangela</em>, made from clay. The beer is now ready to be served. The <em>iphangela</em> is carried from brewery 
              in the kraal (a semi-thatched hut which allows the smoke from the fire to escape and ensures a good supply of oxygen to ferment the mixture) to the drinking assembly. A woman scoops the beer into a drinking vessel, <em>ukhamba</em> (a small, round clay pot decorated with traditional patterns) using a dried gourd and presents it on her knees to the men. She will first taste the beer to show the head of the household that she has brewed the beer properly, and then hand him the <em>ukhamba</em>, before passing it around to the rest. The beer contains \(\text{3}\)% alcohol and it is nutritious as it is made from plant products without modern additives or colourants.

                <p>For the following task, you need to do some research outside of class, using books and the internet. Find out how beer is made in a modern brewery, such as the South African Brewery in Newlands, Cape Town. In the space below, write a paragraph where you compare this modern beer-making process to the indigenous method of the Zulu people. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></li>

            <div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>After researching the method, learners are encouraged to actually carry out the food processing, either at home or in class. On a specified day when learners present their projects, they can bring the actual food product to class for others to taste.</p>

            </p>
            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>You need to read as much as possible about your chosen method of food processing.</li>
              <li>You will need to interview at least one person who uses this method of food processing. Before your interview you will need write down at least 10 different questions to ask this person during the interview. You need to include these questions and the person's answers in your project's presentation.</li>
              <li>
                After your research and interview you need to include a few paragraphs headed: "<strong>What I learnt about food processing ...</strong> " This must be a summary of the information you learnt.
              </li>
              <li>Present your findings in a visible form that you like - perhaps a poster, PowerPoint slide show or in a flip-file as a brochure. Be creative and present your information in a lively and interesting way!</li>
              <li>Use the knowledge and understanding that you gained and process the food using this method.</li>
              <li>You will need to make your presentation to the class. You must include all the steps you followed to process your chosen food. Bring some of your processed food to class so that you can all enjoy what everyone has made.</li>
              <li>When you choose a processing method make sure you have food that you will be able to process using this method! If you cannot find fresh (raw) peaches to poach because it is winter then consider choosing another processing method!</li>
