<p>Teachers are encouraged to make a large circle on the wall using large arrows that can be cut from blue or even black plastic bags. Then cut out white letters to say "Photosynthesis" in the centre of the circle and stick large posters on the arrows to say:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Plants absorb carbon dioxide</li>
<li>Plants release oxygen</li>
<li>Animals breathe in oxygen</li>
<li>Animals breathe out carbon dioxide </li>
</ul><p>Perhaps cut out pictures of plants or get learners to make plants and animals in Art and stick them next to the specific labels they illustrate. Create a glossary by placing words relating to the topic around the classroom. Tell the learners that they are going to be plant investigators, and that their job is to find out what the words mean, and how they relate to plants and photosynthesis.</p>

<p>When introducing this topic remind them of the work on interdependence they covered in Gr. 5. Discuss how animals and plants are interdependent upon each other - plants produce food and oxygen for animals, while animals - when they die - decay, replacing nutrients in the soil for plants, and releasing carbon into the air to continue the carbon cycle.</p>

<p>What happens in a factory? Why do you think we can say plants are like factories? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>A factory is a place where goods or products are made/assembled/manufactured and then delivered to other places to be used. Plants are therefore like factories as they use raw products to make new products (food).</p>

            </div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Why can we say that plants make food for themselves and every animal on earth?
    </div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Plants make food for themselves and plants are the beginning of the food chain, therefore all other animals, whether herbivores which eat plants directly, or carnivores which eat the herbivores, depend on plants for food.</p>

<p>Scientists have a term for substances like chlorophyll that have a colour. They call them pigments. There are other pigments in plants. Can you think of their colours? There are pigments in your body too! Where do you find them? What do they do?</p>

<p>The narrator introduces the play and explains the different processes as these occur.</p>

<p>The sun shines in the centre of the stage and can turn and/or raise their arms to show the sunlight radiating from it.</p>

<p>The carbon dioxide actors run from the animals and circle the plants, and then sit down around the plants.</p>

<p>Now the oxygen and glucose actors rise and run around the plants, and then run to the animals to show they are receiving oxygen and food.</p>

<p>Why do plants die when there is a drought? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
          
<p>There are many processes which shut down without water, photosynthesis being one of them. Plants cannot photosynthesise sunlight without water. If they cannot photosynthesise they cannot create glucose to support life processes within the plant. If the plant cannot support its own life processes it dies. The plant also loses its support from the water in the veins acting as a 'skeleton'.</p>

<p>Using TASTE to check if a food is a sugar or a starch is not very reliable.</p>

<p>Iodine solution is a special solution that is normally a <strong>brown liquid</strong>.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Iodine is what we call an <strong>indicator</strong>.</p>

<p>Just like animals, plants also use oxygen throughout the day and the night. Oxygen is necessary for plant growth and the development of new plants, seeds, leaves and shoots for example. Plants, therefore, also produce carbon dioxide as a 'waste product' once the oxygen has been used.</p>

<p>Plants do not photosynthesise through the night because there is no sunlight energy available to do that. This means that plants only need carbon dioxide during the day, for photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Explain why animals would not survive if all the plants on earth were to suddenly die. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Animals need oxygen for their cells to work and to carry out life processes.</li>
<li>If animals do not have oxygen they cannot carry out the life processes and will die.</li>
<li>Plants also produce food from the sun that animals need to eat for energy to carry out the life processes.</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why do we say the oxygen and carbon dioxide are in a cycle? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>For life on Earth to continue, there needs to be an unlimited supply of carbon dioxide and oxygen. It is in a cycle to ensure that similar amounts of both are produced.</p>

<p>The seedlings that were planted in the newspaper cuttings or cotton wool did not grow very well at all, even though they had sunlight and water. What could they not get from the newspaper or cotton wool that plants normally get from soil? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Nutrients and minerals</p>

<p>Where does photosynthesis usually take place? Explain your answer. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Photosynthesis usually takes place in the leaves. The leaves are green as they contain chlorophyll. Leaves also face the sunlight and are exposed to the most sun to drive the process of photosynthesis.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Do you think photosynthesis takes place at night? Explain your answer. </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>No, it will not take place. At night there is no sunlight energy to drive the process of photosynthesis.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
