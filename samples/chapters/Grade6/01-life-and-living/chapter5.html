          <strong>Introducing this topic</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>Many of the concepts in this unit revise work done in Gr. 5 with the consequence that this unit has taken a different approach: these topics were not dealt with in depth but given a good, clear introduction to revisit and acknowledge existing knowledge and then we move to a stronger focus on environmental problems and permaculture as one of many positive solutions. If at all possible, watch the video clip on permaculture - it is fantastic and inspirational, and makes for far more positive reading than the doom-and-gloom that tends to dominate the media today.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Nothing in the world can live truly on its own. No plant or animal, and certainly no human. Living things are connected to each other, they depend on each other and on the non-living things in their environments.</p>
      
      <p>In this chapter we will take a closer look at ecosystems and examine the different kinds of ecosystems that we get around the world, see how animals, plants and microorganisms depend on each other and learn about food webs and feeding relationships in an ecosystem.</p>

                <div class="problem">Read this blog entry made by a Gr. 6 pupil in Limpopo province reporting on their environment.
                  
                  <p>
                    "I live in the Waterberg area in north Limpopo province. This is the first area in South Africa to be named a <strong>biosphere reserve.</strong> During the Stone Age indigenous people lived in this area. They brought in cattle that overgrazed the grasslands and caused a terrible outbreak of tsetse flies. Then in the 1900s Dutch farmers brought in more cattle. All the cattle, goats and sheep of the Dutch farmers and the indigenous people almost destroyed the natural bushveld vegetation.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Luckily the people realised the problems in time and started to reintroduce and protect original species of animals and plants to the area. White rhino, giraffe, hippopotamuses and different species of antelope and smaller buck returned. Ecotourism is now very popular and farmers try really hard to stop soil erosion, and to introduce original grass species. Farmers also started to take away fences between their farms to allow animals to walk free."</p>

                  <p>The animals over-grazed the land which means most of the natural vegetation was eaten and did not have enough time to regenerate, so the soil was left without protection and started to erode.</p>

                  <p>Because the original animals could no longer find the natural vegetation they were used to, they either starved or moved out of the area.</p>

                  <p>The land would become a barren and desolate place with no vegetation left, which means very little rain will also fall there. The precious topsoil would erode and the landscape would become a desert.</p>

                <div class="solution">
                  
                  <p>They removed the many cattle herds that were over-grazing and replaced them with the original animals that used to live in that area. They also replanted the natural, original plant species that grew well in that area to provide food for the animals. They then advertised this area as a eco-friendly tourist attraction and made lots of money from tourists rather than from destroying the countryside.</p>

                  <p>If the farmers instead of removing the cattle and goats, rather planted crops on the land, what do you think would have eventually happened? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div>
                <div class="solution">
                  
                  <p>The soil would probably not have sustained the crops for many years, so the farmers would spray lots of fertilizers and probably poisonous pest controls which would have further destroyed the environment.</p>
