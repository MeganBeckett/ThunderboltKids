        <p>What is a mixture? A mixture is two or more different materials that have been mixed together.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>In some mixtures, the different materials are still clearly visible after mixing. A mixture of peanuts and raisins would be an example of such a mixture. How would we separate the peanuts and the raisins? Well, we could simply pick the raisins out of the peanuts!</p>

        <p>In other mixtures, the materials are mixed so thoroughly that it seems one material has 'disappeared' into the other. Such mixtures are called solutions. We will learn more about solutions shortly.</p>

          <p>In the previous activity we mixed a solid material (sand) with a liquid (water) and learnt that sometimes a mixture of liquid and solid can be separated by filtering. In the activity the towel was used as a filter.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Is it possible to mix liquids? Can you think of examples of mixtures of liquids? Look at the picture below for some ideas.</p>

          <p>That is right Tom. Let's look at some liquids which are not so easy to mix together.</p>
