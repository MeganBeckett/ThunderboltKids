        <p>In this section we are going to make more solutions. We will perform some experiments to see if we can make our solutes dissolve faster. Before we do that, we have to answer an important question: is melting and dissolving the same? What do you think?</p>

          <p>The difference between melting and dissolving is very relevant, and mistaking dissolving for melting is a pervasive misconception at this stage of the learners' development.</p>

          <p/>
          
          <p>Watch the following short video clip to remind yourself how a solid, liquid and gas are different from each other. You should look out for the part where the states change. The solid changes to a liquid and then the liquid changes into a gas. Remember that a state change is when a substance changes from one state (i.e. solid) to another state (i.e. liquid).</p>

          </p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Temperature: tells us how hot or cold an object is. We measure temperature with a thermometer.</li>
            <li>Grain size: the size of the particles of the substance. A big lump has a large grain size while powder has a small grain size.</li>
            <li>Variable: something (an aspect of the investigation) that we change during an experiment. For instance, in an experiment to compare how fast a solute dissolves at different temperatures, we would change the temperature of the solvent. This means temperature is a variable in this experiment.</li>
          </ul><p>
            This section offers a great opportunity for learners to experience aspects of scientific experimentation that are a little more advanced than what they have done thus far. You could talk about <strong>controlling variables</strong> (changing just one variable in a set, and keeping all the others constant), and how to identify the <strong>independent</strong> and <strong>dependent</strong> variables. They will also be introduced to coming to a <strong>conclusion</strong> at the end of an investigation. Finally, they are introduced to the kinetic molecular model of matter when they learn that particles move faster when they are given energy (just like children!) and when they are moving faster they collide more, which speeds up dissolving. All of this provides a solid foundation for building a more complex understanding of these concepts in later years.

        <p>The rate of dissolving refers to how quickly a solute dissolves in a solvent. The word "rate" has many meanings. In science, when we use the word "rate" we usually mean how fast or how slow.</p>

                  <p>No, it is not a solution as a whole. The milk is suspension, as it is cloudy, and does not dissolve in the water. The coffee granules are an infusion in the water. However, the sugar does dissolve in the water and this forms a solution.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Teacher note: This might be hard for learners to answer, but it is important to note here that "cloudiness" implies that tiny aggregates or globules are suspended in the liquid or gas base. Transparency implies the particles of the substances are separated from each other and dissolved. So the milk is a suspension and not a solution in the water.</p>

          </ol><div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Stirring must occur at the same, regular rate for comparisons to be drawn. Let each group agree on a way to ensure this (perhaps by counting each full "stir" of the spoon).</p>

          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Measure the time it takes for the salt to dissolve completely. Record the time in the table below.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3-5 with the tap water and record the time it takes for the salt to dissolve in the table.</li>

          </ol><div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>This step should be done with the ice OUTSIDE the water used for mixing. Either very cold water from a fridge can be used, or the mixing container should be placed on a bed of crushed ice. The presence of the ice in the mixing water obviously has nothing to do with the rate of dissolution. Additionally, some of the salt may end up on top of the ice and freeze there, creating a situation where it may appear that the salt dissolved quicker in the cold water than the room temperature water.</p>

            <p>Teacher note: This is an opportunity to bring the energy concept into the conversation. Children move faster when they have more energy!

            <p>Ask the learners to say which would contain more grains, a teaspoon of fine salt or a teaspoon of coarse salt.</p>
            
            <p>Sketch the following two scenarios:</p>
            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>In the first scenario there are 30 stones and 30 children. Each child should pick up one stone, and carry it away. Only once the child has moved out of the way can the next child in line pick up a stone. If all the stones are in one large pile it will take a long time for all the stones to be picked up and carried away. This scenario can be compared to the larger grain size particles dissolving in the water.</li>
              <li>In the second scenario there are also 30 stones and 30 children, but this time the stones are in 10 small piles of 3 stones each. In this scenario it is possible to carry 10 stones away at a time, because there are many more small piles. This scenario can be compared to the smaller grains size particles dissolving in the water.</li>
            </ol><p>This is roughly similar to the effect of smaller grain size, the more grains we have, the faster the solute particles can be 'carried away' by the solvent particles.</p>

            <strong>CONCLUSION:</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>The mixture that was stirred dissolved _____ than the mixture that was not stirred. Stirring affects the rate of dissolving.</p>

            <strong>Extension question</strong>: Why do you think stirring makes the salt dissolve faster? 
          </p>
          <hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Particles move faster when they are stirred. When a solute dissolves in a solvent, the solute particles spread out among the solvent particles. This process happens much faster when all the particles are moving faster.</p>

          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The time it takes for a substance to dissolve is called the dissolving rate or the rate of dissolution.</li>
            <li>
              The rate at which a substance dissolves can be affected by 3 factors, namely:
              <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the temperature of the solution;</li>
                <li>whether or not the solution is stirred (or shaken); and</li>
                <li>the grain size of the solute.</li>
              </ul></li>
            <li>A solute will generally dissolve faster if the solvent in which it dissolves is warm.</li>
            <li>A solute will dissolve faster when the solution is stirred or shaken.</li>
            <li>A solute will dissolve faster if the size of its grains is small.</li>
