                  <p>Pollutants are things that do not belong in the water. Insoluble substances (oil, rubbish and waste), soluble substances (chemicals and poisons) and germs are all pollutants.</p>

        <p>We have also learned that nature has special methods of cleaning polluted water. Water purification happens in special natural environments called wetlands. Wetlands are very efficient natural 'water treatment' facilities, but they work slowly. Humans, animals and plants need fresh water every day, and for this reason we have to clean our dirty water so that it can be reused. Cleaning dirty water is what this section is all about.</p>

          <p/>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Our bodies are contain a lot of water. In fact you are mostly water! We need water every day because we lose water everyday with the waste our bodies produce. The water we drink must be clean to prevent us from becoming sick or being poisoned.</li>
            <li>Plants and animals need clean water too, so that they can grow and be healthy. We need healthy plants and animals in our environment because they provide an ecological balance and food.</li>
            <li>Water is also used for fun. Water sports are a very popular recreational activity and include things like swimming, surfing and waterskiing. We want clean water in our seas and lakes so we can enjoy being in the water without becoming ill.</li>

          <p>Imagine you are in a place without clean water. The only water around is a muddy stream. How can the dirty water be made clean enough to drink? When thinking about how to purify water, we need to consider what it is that we need to do to separate the contaminating particles from the water. The muddy water is actually a mixture of sand and water, and possibly other contaminants.</p>

                This is the first time that learners are doing a Technology project this year, in Gr. 6, so you will probably need to remind them of the Design Process which is followed in Technology Projects. The first part is identifying the <strong>need</strong> and in this project a scenario has been set where the Thunderbolt Kids are planning a camping trip and have invited the Gr. 6 class to come with them. However, there is no clean drinking water at the campsite they want to go to and they cannot carry enough water for everyone for the whole trip. Use this scenario to construct the need to design a filter to take with them on the camping trip.
              </p>
              
              <p/>
              
              <p>
                <strong>We follow the pattern IDMEC in the Design Process.</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p/>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Istands for Investigating</strong> the problem which some people have, investigating existing products, and investigating concepts and skills that you will need to solve the problem, i.e. purifying water. Encourage learners to investigate filtering methods such as using sand, cotton wool and charcoal.
              </p>
              
              <p/>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Dstands for Designing.</strong> That means using what you have learnt from investigations to think of good ways to design a filter.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p/>
            <div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>
                <strong>Mstands for Making.</strong> When you make your filter, you use the materials and tools to make the filter according to the design. Notice that most children design with their hands, not only with pencil and paper. As they work with materials they get more ideas, and their design improves. So we should think of designing and making as more or less the same stage of a project.
              </p>
              
              <p/>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Estands for Evaluating.</strong> After you have made your filter to solve the problem, you have to ask, does it work? Could we do a better one? During this phase, take all the learners outside and get them to hang their filters up and test them out by pouring a cup of muddy water through.
                <strong>
                  <u>NB. Make sure learners DO NOT drink the water.</u>
                </strong>
                Rather compare the water before and after filtering to see if it has been purified. Prepare a big bucket of muddy water which you can scoop cups of water out of to purify. That way you will have some water left over to compare the filtered water to, to see if the learners' filters did purify the water.
              </p>
              
              <p/>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Cstands for Communicating.</strong> You must show other people how you decided on your solution to the problem. You need to write and draw your ideas. (The learners should be drawing and writing all through the project. Do not leave the writing until the end, because they find it boring at that stage. When they are getting new ideas they often enjoy writing because they are writing about their own ideas; this is a great strength of Technology in school. A Technology project gives the learners reasons for reading and reasons for writing. As a result, we can address the literacy problem through the subject of Natural Science and Technology.)

            <p>The Thunderbolt Kids are planning a camping trip and they have invited you and your classmates to come with them. They have all the equipment such as tents, sleeping bags and mats. The only problem is that there is no clean drinking water at the campsite. For such a large group, the Thunderbolt Kids cannot take enough bottles of clean water. So, Tom has decided that the group should build a filter to purify the muddy water from the nearby stream. But, they do not know how! We need to help them design and build a filter to purify the water on the camping trip.</p>

            </p>
            
            <p>We now need to do some more investigating about how to purify water. We saw how to purify water using a still and evaporation. But what are the ways to purify water using a filter. Do some research on the internet and in books and answer the following questions.</p>
            
            <p/>
            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
                <p>What types of filters can you make? </p><hr/><hr/></li>

              <li>
                <p>What is the purpose of each of the materials used to filter? For example, are some materials there for filtering large particles and some for filtering small particles? If so, which one is which? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></li>
            </ol><p/>
            
            <p>
              <strong>DESIGN:</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>Now start designing your filter! Answer these questions before you start drawing your design.</p>
            
            <p/>
            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>

                <p>How are you going to hang it up, for example from the branch of a tree? </p><hr/><hr/></li>
              <li>

            <p>
              Use the space below to draw a design for your filter. Remember to label the different parts and show which materials you are going to use. Leave some space to do a second drawing as you might come up with a better design as you are making your filter and see ways to improve it. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

            </p>
            
            <p>Now that you have a design, it is time to make your filter according to the specifications and constraints. Once you have all made your filters, you need to test them out to see if they work.</p>
            
            <p/>
            
            <p>Do the testing outside. Show the class how your filter works and pour a cup of muddy water through the filter and collect the water which comes out.</p>
            
            <p/>
            
            <p>
              <strong>DO NOT DRINK THE WATER</strong> as you do not know if you have completely purified the water. To further purify the water from the filters, you can also do a solar distillation using the still you made in the last activity to remove solids, and finally followed by boiling.

            </p>
            
            <p>After you have made your filter, you have to ask, does it work and could you do a better one?</p>

          <p>South African municipal water is generally clean and fresh, and safe to drink. How does it get that way? This section tells the story of how water is treated.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The water from a tap does not start out clean and fresh. It may come from a river or a dam, or it may even be waste water that was used by a community or in a factory.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            The process of cleaning the water is called <em>water treatment</em>, and the place where it happens is called a <em>water treatment plant</em>.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>So what exactly happens at a typical water treatment plant?</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            There are five steps (or processes) in the treatment of water. The five processes commonly used to treat water are <strong>screening</strong>, <strong>sedimentation, aeration, settling</strong>, and <strong>disinfection</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Let us look at them in turn.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            <strong>STEP 1: SCREENING</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The raw water that arrives at the plant may contain dirt, fish, rubbish, plants and even sewage.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            These things are <strong>screened</strong> out as the water flows into the plant. This means that the water passes through a screen (which is very much like a large sieve), and the solid matter stays behind on the screen.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>After the screening step the water is still dirty, but the large pieces of rubbish have been removed.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            <strong>STEP 2: SETTLING</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            During this step the raw water is allowed to stand in a large tank called a <strong>settling</strong><strong>tank</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          <div class="Questionskid"></div><div class="activity" type="Questions"><h1 class="title"/>
            <p>What happens to the dirt when muddy water stands for a long time? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>It sinks to the bottom.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            When the raw water stands in the settling tank, the medium-sized pieces of solid matter (called <strong>sludge</strong>) sink to the bottom of the tank.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The raw water at the top is still dirty but now it only contains small pieces of solid matter. The bits of solid matter left are small enough for small organisms (such as bacteria) to eat. This is what happens in the next step of the treatment process.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            <strong>STEP 3: AERATION</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The raw water now flows into a special tank that contains bacteria. These are useful bacteria, because they help to break down the last little bits of solid matter as well as breaking down any natural soluble pollutants.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            Since bacteria need oxygen to stay alive and healthy, air is bubbled through the water. This process is called <strong>aeration</strong>, because the name comes from the word 'air'.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            <strong>STEP 4: FILTERING</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            Next, the water flows through a special <strong>filter</strong> made of layers of sand and gravel, just like the one you designed, only much bigger. The gravel layer of the filter is about 30 cm deep and the sand layer is about 1 m deep! The filtering step removes any remaining particles and most of the bacteria left in the water.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>After this step the water is clear, but some germs and bacteria from STEP 3 may still be in the water. Remember that germs and bacteria are small enough to pass between the gaps between sand and gravel.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            <strong>STEP 5: DISINFECTION</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            During <strong>disinfection</strong>, chemicals are added to the water to kill any surviving germs.
          </p>

We use water for washing and cooking and need clean water so that we do not become ill. Many animals make their homes/shelters in and around water and need clean water so that they do not become ill.</p>
