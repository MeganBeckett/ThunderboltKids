        <p>The important message to convey in this section is that solutions ARE mixtures, albeit of a special type. The word mixture is used to describe any combination of two or more substances. A mixture can only be a solution if the particles (and here we are referring to the smallest possible particles, namely molecules) of the two substances are separate from each other and mingle freely with each other. Solutions are mixtures even at the level of molecules (or other fundamental particles).</p>
        
        <p>The CAPS document includes the following two statements that are somewhat problematic:</p>
        
        <p>
          <em>~when substances dissolve, solute particles become dispersed in the spaces between the solvent particles</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <em>~a solution becomes saturated when enough solid solute has been added to fill up all the spaces in the solvent</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>The use of the following alternative statements is recommended:</p>
        
        <p>
          <em>~when substances dissolve, solute particles become</em>
          <em>dispersed</em>
          <em> (spread) throughout the solvent particles</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <em>~a solution is saturated when the maximum amount of solute has been dissolved in the solvent</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>The important idea to convey is that the particles of solute and solvent are closely mixed, in other words they are mixed on the level of atoms and molecules (particles is the preferred term here for learners at this level of development).</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>
          One possible challenge with this chapter and the one following (<em>Dissolving</em>) is that the concepts (solution, dissolving, soluble vs insoluble etc.) are almost inextricably linked, which makes it difficult to explain one concept without using words that are only explained in a later section. For instance, it is really difficult to explain the concept of a solute dispersing into a solvent without using the word <em>dissolve</em> (which is covered conceptually in <em>Solutions</em>, but is only <em>named</em> much later in the chapter <em>Dissolving</em>). The word <em>dissolve</em> will be introduced in this chapter, but used sparingly and only towards the end, so as to sensitise learners to its use, and the way in which the concept links with others in this chapter.

          <p>A solution is a special type of mixture. What makes a solution so special? When is a mixture also a solution?</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Often, the best way to answer a question is to ask it in a different way: When is a mixture NOT a solution?</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>In the next activity we are going to make a few mixtures and then decide which of them are solutions, and which of them are not. That should help us find the answer to the question: When is a mixture also a solution?</p>

              <p>The accepted spelling is 'sulfate' but very few people are aware of this, and most textbooks still use the old spelling 'sulphate'. When working with copper sulfate, as with most chemicals, safety precautions must be adhered to, such as wearing safety goggles and avoiding contact with the skin, eyes and nasal passages. This is a good opportunity to discuss safety precautions in general when doing science investigations, including wearing protective clothing (lab coats, goggles, gloves), as well as acting cautiously and carefully when around chemicals, and especially not drinking or inhaling any substances.</p>

          <p>Good question Tom. We know that science is not magic, and that it is not possible for something to disappear!</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>How do we explain the observation that one substance (the solute) 'disappears' into the other (the solvent)?</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>In the next activity we will look more closely at a solution, in order to understand how it is possible for the solute to look as if it disappears into the solvent.</p>

          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>To emphasise the logic so far, we make observations of things around us and we try to explain them using the models we develop. The learners need to get the message that the particle view is not only a description of a reality we cannot directly observe, but also a tool to explain things that we can observe.</p>

            <p>In the video clip on "How water mixes with a solute to make a solution", the language may be a bit difficult to understand, but if you watch the clip you will get the general idea. However, there is no problem with selling this (and other) clips on the grounds that it uses ideas and language that they (the learners) can access when they get older. You, the teacher, can even challenge the learners to find out about some of the new ideas in this clip and report back to you personally or in class. Forces are also dealt with again in this video - this can be introduced by asking "What keeps the particles of a solid or liquid from moving away from each other?" The answer is that there are forces between the particles.</p>

            <strong>NB:</strong> A very common misconception is that sugar or salt "melts" away when added to water. Dissolving (in the case of sugar and salt in water) requires two materials to be mixed together (a solute will dissolve in a solvent), whereas in melting (in the case of ice), there is heating of one material to change its state. A single substance melts when it changes from one state to another. In order to avoid introducing this misconception which then sticks with learners into the later grades, never use the word "melt" when describing dissolving. Emphasise to learners that the sugar does not melt and that melting is different - it is a change of state.

        <p>In the previous chapter, we saw how to separate mixtures. For example, we could hand sort the objects, sieve the larger grains out of the mixture and decant the oil from the top of the water. But what about a solution? Do you think you can separate the sugar from the solution once it has been dissolved? Let's try to find out the answer to this question!</p>

          <h1 class="title">How can we recover a solute (sugar) from the solution?</h1><section class="maincontent span10"><div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Prepare the sugar solution beforehand (or at the beginning of the class so that learners see you mixing) by mixing sugar into water and making sure it is dissolved. You can prepare enough for the whole class to use or do this experiment as a demonstration. Start off by asking learners if they can see the sugar. Revise the concept that it has dissolved into the water to form a solution. Before starting the investigation, ask the learners how they think you could separate or recover the sugar from the solution.</p>
            <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Ask learners if they think you could separate by sieving or filtering. After they answer you, demonstrate filtering by pouring the sugar solution through filter paper placed in a funnel into another beaker. Show the learners the filter paper so that they can then see that there is no sugar left behind on the filter paper. They can fill in their observations in the table.</li>
              <li>Ask learners if they think settling will work. You could prepare a sugar solution the day before the class and then leave it overnight in the classroom and tell learners you want to see the next day whether the sugar has settled out of the solution. They can then see for themselves the next day during the next lesson that it has not settled out and that this technique cannot be used to separate a sugar solution. They can fill in their observations in the table.</li>
            </ul></div>
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Continued...</p>
            <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The next step is to see what will happen if we evaporate the water. This probably will not be a logical step for the learners to take. So ask leading questions such as, what do they think will happen to a dish of water if you leave it outside in the sun. Answer: It will evaporate. Note though, that evaporation does not need heat to take place, but the heat from the sun will speed up the process.</li>
              <li>Ask learners what they think will happen to the sugar solution if you leave it outside in a dish to evaporate? Will the water evaporate? What will happen to the sugar? The learners should see the need to perform the investigation from asking these questions as the answer might not be obvious.</li>
              <li>While you are waiting for the water to evaporate and leave behind the sugar crystals, you can demonstrate another way of recovering the sugar (solute) which is by boiling the sugar solution. Set up a beaker of the sugar solution on a stand over a Bunsen burner. Light the Bunsen burner and allow the solution to boil. Do not put a lot of the sugar solution into the beaker otherwise the demonstration will take too long. Boiling speeds up the process and the last remaining water can be left to evaporate until only sugar crystals are left at the bottom of the beaker. This is called crystallisation.</li>

Do you drink tea, for example, and put sugar in? How many teaspoons of sugar do you think you can dissolve in a cup of tea? In the next section we will explore this idea.</p>

            <p>This investigation makes the ideal demonstration, and could even be given as a homework experiment. It also allows for the extension of learners' understanding of the concept of solubility and saturated solutions. You could heat the saturated sugar solution for the learners to show that more solute will dissolve when the solvent is at a higher temperature (this is mostly true, but not always!). If more sugar is added to the heated solution until it is saturated at the higher temperature, then the solution will be supersaturated when cooled. A sugar crystal can be suspended in the solution before it cools down and more sugar crystals will grow on the crystal and on the thread used to suspend the crystal. The less the solution is disturbed, the larger the crystals will grow.</p>

            <p>Sugar crystals can take a few days to a week to "grow", so set up this experiment and then leave the jars on the windowsill where they will not be disturbed. You can use different coloured food colouring so that learners have brightly coloured crystals at the end. Each learner can make their own or you can scale up the quantities below and make it in one big beaker, or possibly three different ones with different colours. The quantities listed below are for one crystal to grow in one jar. However, it would be ideal for each learner to have their own crystal.</p>

            <li>Stir after each spoonful and keep adding sugar until the sugar won't dissolve any more in the water. If you do not add enough sugar, your crystals will not grow quickly. If you use too much sugar, your crystals will grow on the undissolved crystals and not on the string.</li>
            <li>Pour some food colouring into your saturated solution to give the crystals a colour.</li>
            <li>Pour your solution into the clear glass jar. If you have undissolved sugar at the bottom of your container, avoid getting it in the jar.</li>

              The best crystals form when the process happens slowly and the water cools down slowly. The cooled solution has a concentration above the saturation point and is said to be <strong>supersaturated.</strong> Crystal will more easily form when they have a place to start growing, like on the string.

                  <p>This might be quite difficult for learners to answer but have this question as a class discussion. Boiling the water allows one to dissolve more solute than if the water was cool or at room temperature. This results in a supersatured solution.</p>

          <p>Have you ever visited a cave? Inside, you may have seen crystal formations called stalactites and stalagmites. Stalactites and stalagmites form inside limestone caves. Stalactites hang down like icicles and stalagmites grow from the floor of the cave upwards. Stalactites and stalagmites always occur in pairs. Caves form when water slowly dissolves the limestone underground. The dissolved limestone can crystallise again when the water evaporates. This is also a slow process and it happens when water drips down from the ceiling of the cave over a long period of time. The water drops that land on the floor of the cave evaporate over time, and where they fall on the same spot repeatedly, a stalagmite eventually forms. Over many thousands of years, the stalactite and stalagmite may connect to become a column.</p>

            We have a word for substances that do NOT form solutions when they are mixed with water. These substances are called <strong>insoluble</strong> substances.

          <p>Some substances that are insoluble in water may be soluble in other solvents! Think about this for a moment: Is nail polish soluble in water? No, of course not, or it would be possible to wash it off! What would be a good solvent for nail polish?</p>

          <p>What have we learnt about solutions as special mixtures?</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Soluble substances dissolve in water and insoluble substances do not dissolve in water.</p>
          
          <p>
            Water is not the only solvent. Some substances which are not soluble in water are soluble in other solvents. When no more solute can dissolve in a solution, we say it is a <strong>saturated solution</strong>. An <strong>unsaturated solution</strong> is one where it is possible to dissolve more solute in the solvent.

          <p/>
          
          <p>Solutions are special kinds of mixtures. When we want to decide whether a mixture is also a solution, we can use the following questions to decide:</p>
