        We have learnt that water can dissolve many substances -  water is a good <em>solvent</em>. When water has unhealthy substances in it, we say the water is <em>polluted.</em> Polluted water is not clean.

        <p>When is water clean? We could say that clean water is free of pollutants.</p>
        
        <p/>
        <p>What are pollutants? Pollutants are substances (or objects) that do not naturally belong in the water and are harmful to us and to the environment.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>Pollutants may be any of the following:</p>
        <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Insoluble pollutants: these are things that do not dissolve in the water but make it dirty, such as oil, garbage and toilet waste (sewage).</li>
          <li>Soluble pollutants: these are chemicals (eg. soaps, fertilisers) and poisons (eg. insecticides).</li>
          <li>Living germs (bacteria) that can cause people or animals to get sick.</li>
        </ul><p/>
        <div class="teachers-guide">
          <p>There is an interesting term in the video clip on Water Pollution: "natural pollutants". It is a nice topic for a short discussion. Even things that are quite natural can act as pollutants when released in large quantities. Human sewage is an extreme example. Most ecosystems are "buffered" against abnormal amounts of such substances, but only up to a certain point.</p>

        <p>In the next activity we will discuss pollution and where it comes from.</p>

        <p>As humans, we often forget that we are sharing this natural resource with many other organisms.  Many of our activities can change the quality of the water in a way that affects the health and behaviour of other organisms.</p>

          Nature has special methods of cleaning polluted water. In nature, water is purified in natural environments called <em>wetlands</em>. Wetlands are very efficient natural 'water treatment' facilities, and in this section we will learn how they work.

          <p>An area is a wetland if it has the following:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>waterlogged soil,</li>
            <li>water-loving plants and</li>
            <li>a high water table.</li>
          </ul><p/>
          
          <p>If soil is waterlogged, it means that it is full of water. The water table refers to the level in the ground where all the soil below this level is waterlogged (full of water). If an area has a high water table, then this level is close to the surface. This means water will not filter down into the ground but remain on the surface forming a wetland.</p>
          
          <p/>

          <p>Wetlands are very special places that should be protected. Why are they so important?</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Three unique abilities of wetlands make them very important.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
              <em>Wetlands are like giant sponges</em>:
            </li>
          </ol><p/>
          
          <p>
            Wetlands <strong>soak up water</strong> and <strong>store</strong> it.  During a drought, when there is not much rain, this stored water can help to keep rivers and streams flowing so that animals and plants can stay alive.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
              <em>Wetlands slow down flood waters</em>:
            </li>
          </ol><p/>
          
          <p>Water that is 'in flood' flows so strongly and quickly that it becomes dangerous. It can drown people and animals and it can cause damage to property and also to the environment, through soil erosion. Floodwater slows down when it flows into a wetland, because the wetland is a large area that can hold a large amount of water.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
              <em>Wetlands are natural filtration systems for</em><em> purifying</em><em> water</em>:
            </li>
          </ol><p/>
          
          <p>As water flows through the wetland, it is filtered. Plants in the wetland trap soil particles and sediments, nutrients, as well as pollutants and disease-causing organisms which make the water unsafe.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>With regards to the pollutants being filtered from wetlands, it is only certain kinds, and only in certain loads. Insoluble wastes such as plastics should not end up in a wetland. Bacteria and other germs are neutralized. Chemical pollutants such as heavy metals are trapped, but if they become concentrated in too large amounts, they need to be taken out by removing plant matter that has absorbed them.</p>

            <section class="maincontent span10"><p>Teacher note: The reason for doing this activity is to help learners understand how different surfaces, especially those covered in plants, allow water to drain at different rates allowing soil to retain much of the water, and other surfaces to lose a lot of water. This will also show how wetlands help to slow down water and filter it.</p>

                Arrange a visit to a nature reserve to study a wetland area firsthand. Or invite a speaker from a nature conservation site (such as SANParks) to talk to your class about wetlands. <strong>BEFORE the visit:</strong> tell learners to read through the information brought to school and some of the books and reading material in your class. From this information, set at least 5 questions that you could ask the Nature Conservation Officer when s/he comes to visit your class, or when you go on the outing to the nature reserve. At least 2 of these questions should focus on the dangers to wetlands.<strong>DURING the visit:</strong> Tell learners to REMEMBER to take many notes while listening to the Nature Conservation Officer.<strong>AFTER the visit:</strong> In their groups, learners must make a poster about wetlands, using the questions to guide them. <strong>NB.</strong> If you do not manage to visit a wetland, 
                learners must still complete the research task by reading up on the internet and in books to answer the questions and present a poster.
