        <p>On Earth we see only one side of the Moon. Nobody knew what the far side to the Moon looked like until the Soviet Luna spacecraft went into orbit around the Moon in 1959 and photographed the far side. The force of gravity between the Earth and Moon holds the Moon's near side facing us.</p>

          <p>It is a very difficult concept to understand that we only ever see one side of the Moon, yet the Moon still rotates. The following dramatisation will help learners to understand this. Make sure that the ball being used has a clear mark on one side so that this can be used as a reference.</p>

            <li>As you are moving the ball around yourself, you only ever see one side of the ball. Do you agree?</li>
            <li>Your partner must stand on one side of you as you swing the ball around. What does this person see? They will see different sides of the ball.</li>
            <li>Take it in turns to be the one moving the ball around as you rotate and the one observing.</li>

          <p>
            The learner swinging the ball always sees the same side of the ball, but a person standing watching the ball will say that it rotates. The red mark on the ball will point to the <strong>side</strong> of the room, then to the <strong>back</strong> of the room, then to the <strong>other side</strong>, and then to the <strong>front</strong> of the room.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>So the person watching will say that the ball has rotated, and also revolved.</p>

          <p>For the following activity, divide the class up into groups. First let them discuss how they are going to act out the movement, using the knowledge and movements from the last two activities. They have to put these together. You can chose some learners as judges who decide which group understands the movements best. This activity requires learners to work in a group to come up with an answer and present it to the class. You can also get the learners to explain what they are doing as they are acting out to see if they really understand the movement.</p>
