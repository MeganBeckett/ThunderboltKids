Now we are going to explore Space a bit more! Before carrying on, let's refresh our memories on some of the things about Space from Gr. 4.</p>

            <p>The following pages contain a lot of text and not much in the way of activities and writing. This is intended to be told as an interesting story to your learners. Read through this together. Get learners to read different parts at different times. As you are going through it, ask the class different questions, such as "Do you know the names of any constellations?", "Can you remember the names of all 8 planets?", "Do you know the names of any other Greek philosophers?" (E.g. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle). This can also be used as revision to remind learners about what they learnt in Gr. 4 about the solar system.</p>

          <p>Long, long ago, people watched the stars at night. Shepherds looking after sheep and cattle would lie down and look at the night sky. People in hot regions like Mesopotamia (now Iraq) slept on the roofs of their houses. They had plenty of time to look at the stars. They knew the patterns of stars in the sky and how the stars moved across the sky during the night. The patterns were fixed (they did not change). For example, you can find a pattern like the Southern Cross if you look up towards the South. You can see it in the first photo below. The second photo with white lines helps you to see the Cross. It always looks the same because the stars are always the same distance apart.</p>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0006.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0006.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">This pattern of stars is the Southern Cross.

          <p>Patterns of stars are called constellations. The next image shows some other famous constellations of stars which you can see in the night sky.</p>

          <p>People noticed that some bright objects did not behave like the others. These objects are close to a star one night and then the next night, at the same time, the object has moved away from the star. Night after night, these objects appear in new positions among the stars.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            The Greeks of those times called these objects "the wanderers" because they were in a slightly different position each night. The Greek word for wanderer is "<em>planetes</em>" and so we get the English word "planet". A person who wanders is someone who walks around wherever he feels like going.

            <strong>The planets were a science puzzle</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>People who study the stars are called astronomers. The planets were a puzzle for ancient astronomers. Why did they move differently to the stars? Were they just as far away as the stars? Why were they brighter at some times of the year than at other times?</p>
          
          <p/>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0009.png"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0009.png" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">You can see the planet Venus just after the Sun has set. Venus is usually very bright. At some times of the year, you have to look for Venus in the dark sky where the Sun will rise.</figcaption></figure><p/>
          
          <p>The ancient peoples gave names to the planets. For example, Mars was named after the god of war. One planet was so beautiful that they called it Venus after the goddess of love and beauty.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>You can see Mars at some times of the year. Mars is orange-red, and at most times it looks smaller than Venus. It is not as easy to find as Venus is; sometimes you have to look late at night to see Mars rising in the east.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            <strong>How astronomers solved the puzzle</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Over hundreds of years, astronomers set up observatories in places like India, Egypt, Iraq, England and countries in Europe. An observatory is a building that has permanent measuring marks. These marks are always in the same position. The astronomers make notes of where stars and planets are compared to these fixed positions, and they note the dates and times.</p>
          <p/>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0010.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0010.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">Hypatia was an astronomer and mathematician at the University of Alexandria in Egypt. She lived about 1700 years ago. Can you see the globe next to her in this old drawing?</figcaption></figure><p/>
          
          <p>Over many years of careful observing, the astronomers kept records of where the planets moved. They used maths to predict where a planet would be on a future date. Then, on that date, they went to check if their prediction was correct. They became very good at measuring, doing maths and doing calculations with big numbers.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0011.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0011.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">Ancient astronomers making observations </figcaption></figure><p/>
          
          <p>So they worked out that the planets are closer to us than the stars, and that the planets are moving around the Sun. Then they realised that Earth is a planet too, and it is moving around the Sun!</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>This idea upset some people who believed that the Earth was the centre of the universe and that everything moved around the Earth. Nowadays we know exactly where each planet in our solar system is at any time, and we can actually send spacecraft to the planets.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The Sun together with the planets moving around it is called the solar system. You will learn about that next.</p>

          <p>In the solar system, each object's force of gravity pulls on all the other objects. Gravity is a force of attraction between objects. The Sun is the biggest and heaviest object in our solar system and so it exerts the greatest force of gravity on all the planets.

              <p>This is a demonstration, using two learners at a time. One learner must run with the ball to get it moving in a circle. You need plenty of room; at least a clear 10-metre-diameter circle. The long string helps to give learners the correct idea that the Earth's orbit is at a very great radius from the Sun. Plan this to happen at the start or end of a period, because the learners take time to move outside. This activity was also included in the Gr. 4 workbook to show revolution of the planets around the Sun. In Gr. 6, it is also important for learners to understand that not only do planets revolve around the Sun, but they also rotate on their axis. After doing this activity, also get one learner to stand in the centre as the Sun and hold several pieces of string, or you the teacher can do this. Several learners then hold the ends of the strings and spread out and walk around the teacher/learner in the middle. They are now revolving. As they are revolving, ask learners to now 
                also spin as they are revolving. Explain that they are now also rotating as planets rotate on their axis at the same time that they are revolving around the Sun.

          <p>The planet Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.25 days and we call that one year. As Earth moves to new positions around the Sun, we have four seasons: summer, autumn, winter and spring, and then summer comes again.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Now in Space, the Earth keeps on going around the Sun at more than 100 000 kilometres every hour. However, there is no string pulling on the Earth, so what keeps it moving?</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The force of gravity pulls the Sun and the Earth towards each other.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <p/>
          
          <p>There is no string in Space between Earth and the Sun! The Earth would move away, but the Sun "traps" the Earth with its much greater force of gravity. The Sun pulls on the Earth and the Earth pulls on the Sun with the force of gravity. The pull is so strong that it works at a distance of 150 million kilometres! Like the string, force of gravity keeps the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun, year after year.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>It does the same for the other planets too. The force of gravity pulls the planet Neptune into its orbit even though Neptune is 30 times further away from the Sun than Earth is.</p>

            <strong>Mercury</strong> is closest to the Sun, and the smallest planet. It has no atmosphere and its grey surface is marked with thousands of craters. A crater is the mark that we see where a rock has crashed onto a planet or a moon.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Venus</strong> is second closest to the Sun. It is almost the same size as Earth. To us, it looks white and it shines brightly in the evening or morning.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Venus shines brightly like that because it is covered in a thick cloud of gas. It would be horrible to breathe the atmosphere on Venus, because the gas is mostly carbon dioxide and sulphuric acid! The atmosphere absorbs lots of heat from the Sun and does not cool down at night. Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system.</p>

            Then we reach <strong>Earth</strong> - the blue planet, our home in Space. You know a lot about Earth already. Earth has its Moon that we know well. The Moon moves in its orbit around the Earth.

          <p/>
          
          <p>
            Next furthest out is <strong>Mars</strong>, the red planet. We know quite a lot about Mars. Many spacecraft have been sent to Mars to take photographs and some spacecraft even landed to take samples of the soil.

          <p>Mars needs almost two Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun, so if you lived on Mars you would have to wait a very long time for your birthday. Mars spins like the Earth, and a day on Mars is almost the same length as a day on Earth. A day on Mars is called a sol.</p>

          <p/>
          
          <p>This planet is further from the Sun than Earth, and for this reason it is very cold. It has a thin atmosphere but this atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide gas. Humans cannot breathe that atmosphere.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The surface is mostly sand and rocks. The sand is full of iron oxide, which is the same substance as red-orange rust. From Earth we see Mars as a small red-orange dot in the sky, because of the colour of the soil.</p>

          <p>
            There are some very big valleys on Mars. Valleys are caused by erosion when water flows downhill, so we can <strong>make an inference</strong> that there was a lot of water on the planet long ago. If there was water, perhaps there were living things on Mars too. But we cannot be sure. Scientists have sent another spacecraft to look carefully at the rocks and sand. The spacecraft is called <em>Curiosity</em> and it will try to find signs of living things in the ground.

            <p>Mars is smaller than Earth and if you went there, your weight would be only about a third (\(\frac{\text{1}}{\text{3}}\)) of  your weight on Earth.</p>

                    <p>In fact, your weight on Mars would be \(\text{37,7}\)% of your weight on Earth. We have rounded the number to simplify the calculation. If learners query this then you can show them the following calculations:

          <p>Now we have to go very far from the Sun, 5 times further than Earth is from the Sun. We begin to see the gas giants, which are the four outer planets. These gas giants have no solid surface we could land on. They are huge balls of gas and if we came close we would fly through clouds of cold gases.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Jupiter</strong> is the first gas giant we come to, and it is the biggest of all the planets. From Earth we see it shining white but close up, its colour is light pink-brown. It is bigger than all the other planets put together.
          </p>
          
          <p/>

Winds blow from east to west on Jupiter's surface, and they blow at the speed of jet planes. The surface is very cold, and some of the gases are so cold that they have become liquid or solid.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Deep inside, Jupiter may have a very hot core of rock. Jupiter has four big moons, and sixty smaller ones.</p>
          <p/>
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            If we now go even further into Space, to double the distance we went to reach Jupiter, we reach the planet Saturn. <strong>Saturn</strong> is almost as big as Jupiter but it has a light yellow colour. It is mostly gas and it has rings of rock spread out and spinning around it. Saturn has about 62 moons.
          </p>

          <p/>
          
          <p>
            Then we get <strong>Uranus</strong>, a smooth blue-green ball of gas, with almost no marks and shapes on it that we can see. It has more than 25 moons.

            Now we are more than 30 times further from the Sun than Earth is, and we see the last planet, Neptune. <strong>Neptune</strong> is also a ball of gas and looks like Uranus. It has about 12 moons, and possibly more.  Neptune has  a very 'stormy' surface. Images of the planet often show huge storms and winds.

          <p>In 1973, Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to travel to Jupiter. To get there, Pioneer 10 had to go through the asteroid belt. Do you remember how fast asteroids are moving? If an asteroid had hit Pioneer 10, the spacecraft would have been destroyed and smashed to pieces. However, Space is a very big place and the asteroids are usually far apart. Pioneer 10 got through safely and went on to take the first close-up photos of Jupiter.</p>

          <p>Many people say that the full Moon looks bigger when it rises just after sunset, and then looks smaller late at night. Is this true? Let's do an investigation to find out.</p>

            <p>The following investigation needs to be carried out on a night when the Moon is full. Come back to it at a later time in the month if you have to wait awhile and carry on with the rest of the content in the meantime.</p>

            <div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>Most of them will find that the measurements are the same. Some learners will have made mistakes and will say that the high Moon was smaller, so you can ask for a show of hands - "who found that the measurements were the same at 6:00 and 8:00 p.m.?" Now in science, ideas cannot be tested by majority vote. In science, just one careful investigation can undo a majority opinion. If other people can investigate the idea and get that same measurement, then an idea can be changed or confirmed. You can ask the class to go and repeat the investigation tonight. The Moon will still be full, but will rise about 50 minutes later.</p>

            <p>The footprints from the astronauts who first walked on the Moon are still there! There is no wind on the Moon to blow them away.</p>

            <p>A spacecraft a few years ago found signs of water frozen under the south pole of the Moon. Scientists are not sure how the water got there.</p>

          <p>The Moon has a pale grey surface with dark grey marks on it. Nobody knew what the surface was like until spacecraft landed on the Moon. The first astronauts to walk on the Moon stepped into fine, powdery dust. They collected rock samples (small pieces) to bring back to Earth.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The surface of the Moon is covered with holes called craters. These craters are made by space rocks that hit the Moon. These rocks may be as small as grains of sand or as big as a house. They travel so fast that they explode when they hit the Moon, and they make a round hole.</p>

          <p>The light-coloured areas on the Moon are mountains, and the darker areas are plains. Some of these plains were made by huge space rocks that made craters 300 km wide. Other plains were made by volcanoes on the Moon a long time ago. Lava* flowed out from those volcanoes. Nowadays the Moon has no volcanoes.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The Moon has no air so there is no wind to blow the dust. The Moon has no water, so there is no rain to wash away sand and cause erosion. That is the reason why we see the craters on the Moon so clearly.</p>

                  <p>(a) The Moon has no atmosphere to protect it. Earth has an atmosphere so most rocks from space burn up before they reach the ground. (b) Earth has been hit by meteoroids, as the Moon was, but erosion has worn down the craters so that we cannot see them clearly any more.</p>

                  The Earth is travelling through Space at \(\text{100\ 000}\) kilometres in every hour. How can we work that out? Here is information for you to use: The length of the Earth's path around the Sun is 942 million kilometres and it takes 365\(\frac{\text{1}}{\text{4}}\) days to go all the way around. Now you can work it out for yourself. <strong>Hint to help you:</strong> How many hours are there in one day? <hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div>

                  <p>This is a challenge for your learners. They will not be used to working with very big numbers. They will probably need calculators. However, they know what answer they should get.</p>
