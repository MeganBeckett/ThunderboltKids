          <p>East and West are two directions you must know. If you point at the Sun when it appears to rise in the morning, you are pointing in the direction of East. If you point at the place where the Sun sets, you are pointing direction of West. Have a look at the picture of Sophie. Sophie loves to get up early and watch the sunrise. She is standing with her arms stretched out, pointing in the directions East and West.</p>

                  <div class="problem">Now find the direction of East in your classroom. You must point to the place where  you see the Sun come up in the morning. In the classroom, stretch  out your arms and point in the direction of East and West. Clean the floor and stick some insulating tape on the floor so that everyone can remember which direction is East and which direction is West.
                  </div>
                  <div class="solution">
                    
                    <p>Help your learners understand that East is not really a place. Wherever you are on Earth, you can point towards East and if you keep walking East you will see the sunrise in front of you every morning. This idea can be a little confusing because we do talk about places like Mpumalanga, the place where the Sun rises. But if you actually go to Mpumalanga's eastern border, then you see the Sun rise over Mozambique. In Mozambique, the Sun rises over the sea, and so on.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p/>
                    
                    
                    <p>So the difference between the words "place" and "direction" is important. We see this if we ask the question "How far must I walk to reach the East?" The answer is "You can never reach it; the East will always be in front of you."</p>
                    
                    
                    <p/>
                    
                    
                    <p>This becomes practically significant when we tell the learners that the Earth rotates towards the East. You cannot find a place on the globe that is marked "the East".</p>

            What does the word "direction" mean? You can walk in a <strong>direction</strong> towards a place. If the wind blows, you see leaves moving in the same <strong>direction</strong> as the wind. Remember, a direction is not a place that you can reach!

              <p>NB: The Sun does not actually "go" anywhere at night! We may talk about the movement of the Sun across the sky in everyday language, but this is INCORRECT. The Sun does not move - the Earth rotates on its axis. In the rest of this section, make it clear to learners that the Sun may appear to move across the sky, but it is actually the Earth that is spinning which makes it look like the Sun moves.</p>

          <section class="maincontent span10"><p>When you ride in a bus, you may see houses outside the bus. It looks as if the houses move past your window.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0043.png"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0043.png" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">To Sophie, who is riding in a bus, it looks like the houses are moving past.</figcaption></figure><p/>
          <div class="Questionskid"></div><div class="activity" type="Questions"><h1 class="title"/>
            <p>Why do the  houses seem to move past your window? Are the houses really moving?  Discuss this question.</p><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>
                Don't accept an answer "No, they are not moving"; ask <strong>why</strong> they seem to move. Learners must realise that the houses <strong>seem</strong> to move but it happens because the person in the bus is moving. We want learners to put this idea into words for themselves.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>So it is really the person in the bus who is moving; it looks to the person as though the houses are moving, but they are not moving.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>You saw how big the Sun is when we compare the Earth and the Sun. Go back to the beginning of this term's work to find the picture of the Sun and the Earth. That great big Sun does not move around the Earth.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>The Earth is turning around and that is why we see the Sun move past us. We are like Sophie in the bus. She is in the bus and she is moving past the houses. The Sun is like the houses; they are not moving. It looks to us as though the Sun is moving, but it's really the Earth that is turning around.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>You can think of the Earth as an orange with a pencil through it.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0044.png"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0044.png" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">The Earth spins like an orange on a pencil.</figcaption></figure><p/>
          
          <p>
            If you twist the pencil, the whole orange spins around. This is like the Earth spinning around. The pencil is called the axis of the orange. In the same way, we can think of an axis that goes through the Earth. The axis is a line that we can imagine, it is not a real thing. Earth spins around that axis. We say the Earth <strong>rotates</strong> (spins).
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>We say that the Earth has an axis that it rotates on. This axis runs from the North Pole to the South Pole as you can see in the picture.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p/>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0045.png"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0045.png" width="300"/></noscript></figure><p/>
          
          <p>Other objects also have axes of rotation. For example, an ice skater has a vertical axis that she rotates on when spinning on a spot during her performance.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>A log which is floating in water can also roll around. It will have a horizontal axis of rotation.</p>

          By now you know that all the planets revolve (travel) around the Sun. Each planet has its own pathway. This is called its orbit. We can also say planets orbit the Sun. Earth also moves in its own orbit around the Sun. This movement is called the <strong>revolution</strong> of the Earth around the Sun. We can also say that the Earth <strong>orbits</strong> around the Sun.
        </p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>We have now come across two new words: rotation and revolution. Remember, these are not the same thing! Let's do an activity using our own bodies to understand the difference between revolution and rotation.</p>
        
        <p/>
        <div class="teachers-guide">
          <p>Most people, including adults, mix up the terms `revolution' and `rotation'. The simplest way to deal with this is to say that the Earth spins around its own axis, and it orbits around the Sun. We can use "orbit" as a verb. In the next activity, make sure to show the difference in the body movements when rotating and when revolving. Explain to learners when they are doing each one. This is also another way of making a model of the motions of the Earth. We did it before, with the ball swinging around on a long string.</p>

            <li>First, the whole class must stand, and spread out. Now spin around with your arms out, staying on one spot. This is called rotation! The Earth rotates like this on its axis.</li>
            <li>Now get into pairs. One learner must stand in one spot and the other learner must walk in a circle around the other person. This is revolution. The second learner is revolving around the learner standing still in the middle. The Earth revolves around the Sun like this.</li>
            <li>Now, let's put both movements together! As the Earth rotates on its axis, it also revolves around the Sun. This might be tricky! Spin around (rotate) while also moving in a big circle around your partner (revolve). Look at the picture below.</li>

                    <p>Every 4 years we have a leap year, which is when there is one extra day in the year. This is because the Earth actually takes 365.25 days to revolve around the Sun, and not just 365 days. So every 4 years, we have an extra day to account for these quarter days.</p>
