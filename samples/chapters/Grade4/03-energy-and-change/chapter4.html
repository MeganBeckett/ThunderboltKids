        <p>For this chapter, keep the musical instruments
          which were made by the learners in the previous chapter on display in the
          classroom. You can then use these instruments to demonstrate various concepts in
          this chapter. Alternatively, this chapter could be done before the chapter on
          "Movement and Energy in a System" where a musical instrument is made as this
          chapter deals with a lot of concepts and investigations into sound that can then
          be explored when making the musical instrument. Or else, if you are doing this
          chapter now after making a musical instrument, then use what they first
          experienced by investigating hands-on when you now deal with the theory.

            hum which you could feel with your hand. It causes the sound you make when you
            speak and when you shout and when you sing.
          </p>
          
          <p>What is vibrating in your throat? You have
            vocal cords in your throat. As air moves over them they vibrate. As they
            vibrate they cause sound. Look at the picture below. The vocal cords are almost
            like the layer of cling film over the bowl in the previous activity which
            vibrates.

            </figcaption></figure><p>So we make sounds when our vocal cords
            vibrate, but how do we hear sounds? In your ear you have eardrums. Eardrums
            helps us to hear the sound. Your eardrum acts like the cling film. Your eardrums
            vibrate when a sound goes into your ear. This is how you hear sounds!
          </p>
          
          <p>The human ear is actually made of many small
            parts! Your outer ear is what you can see on the sides of your head. Your inner
            ear is inside your skull and made of small bones. Look at the picture below. Can
            you see the eardrum which vibrates? This vibration then bumps the little bone
            next to it and the brain can read this as a sound.

              <p>The following idea seems quite tangible... just
                letting the kids "move" to experience how the vibration is transmitted from one

                requires no mention of waves. Sound waves are only introduced in the later
                grades. This activity can help to entrench most of the ideas developed so far

            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
                <p>Why does this tin-telephone work? How does the sound you make

              <p>The sound travels
                along the string. It also travels through air, but its not the same as the sound
                travelling through the string. The conclusion is that sound exists only in a
                medium, and it travels better through the string than through the air. For
                interest, a quick discussion about sound in space: sound cannot travel in space
                even if vibrations occur - there is no medium for it to move through. Here, sound
                is carried in three stages: through the air from the vocal cords to the base of the tin;
                through the string from the base of the first tin to the base of the second tin; through the air from
                the base of the second tin to the eardrum. A rich and valuable class discussion can evolve
                from asking how exactly the vibration energy of the speaker's vocal cords ends
                up as vibration energy of the hearer's eardrum.

                    <p>This might be hard for learners to answer as it
                      has to do with the arrangement of particles in solids and gases. It is because
                      the particles in solids are close to each other. In gases they are quite far
                      apart compared to solids. This is why solids can carry sound energy better and
                      further than gases.

            <p>After an earthquake people may be trapped under broken buildings.
              Survivors are sometimes found days after an earthquake. They make tapping noises

            <p>As an extension, if you are able to watch the

              is full of air. We can hear the bell ringing. Slowly, the air is pumped out of
              the jar by the vacuum pump. The bell sounds softer and softer until you can't
              hear it all. Explain the observations: Initially there is air in the jar so the
              vibrations from the bell can be carried through the air by one particle of air
              causing the next particle of air to vibrate. Once the air has been removed, the
              bell can't cause anything to vibrate so the sound cannot be carried from the
              bell to your ear.

              respectively. Or if you have another instrument with different length strings,
              pluck the strings to show the difference in pitch. The shorter strings will
              vibrate quicker and therefore produce a higher pitch, whereas the longer strings

                    <p>The megaphone (also called a loudhailer) makes

                    <p>This can be quite tricky for learners to answer
                      by themselves so do it as a class discussion. This presents a good opportunity
                      to allow a bit of reasoning to take place in these discussions. There is a
                      paradox to be resolved: louder sounds mean more sound energy reaching your ears,
                      but if you speak in the same way with and without a megaphone, the sound must
                      have the same energy. The idea is that the sound is reflected from the internal
                      walls of the funnel and projected forwards towards the large opening. The sound
                      is therefore concentrated in one direction meaning that more of the sound energy
                      travels towards the hearer making it seem louder than it is without the
                      device.

                causing the sound to be amplified as the vibrations are intensified.

            Some factories and building sites are noisy places.
          </p>
          
          <p>Animals can be harmed by noise pollution. A
            good example is the whale. Whales communicate with each other by making sounds.
            The sound can travel over long distances through the water from the one whale to
            the next. When there are lots of ships present, they make additional noise.
            Water carries these noises very well and very far. This makes it difficult for
            whales to communicate with each other. This can cause whales to get lost in the
            ocean.
