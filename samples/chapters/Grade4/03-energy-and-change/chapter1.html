            <p>In our daily lives, there are many things that we
              do that need energy. As we get energy from food, it is important for us to eat
              breakfast. Learners need to be able
              to recognise where energy is needed for living and other processes. Cleaning
              teeth, walking, running, reading, writing all need energy. Turning on lights and
              cooking food use energy. Warming our homes in winter or cooling our homes in
              summer uses energy. Drying clothes on the washing line. There are bicycles,
              motor cars, motor bikes and aeroplanes; all these kinds of transport need
              energy to move. It is up to the teacher to ask as many open-ended questions as
              possible to get learners to discuss the different uses of energy.

                  <p>The short answer: Black paper absorbs light so
                    thermometer temperature is greater. White paper reflects light so thermometer
                    gets less light. In the shade, thermometer is sheltered from the Sun, so less
                    heat reaches thermometer so temperature will be less.

                  <p>A longer explanation for these results: A
                    thermometer measures the temperature of the air around its bulb. The more energy
                    the air particles have, the higher the temperature will be. When we place a
                    thermometer in the shade it is sheltered from the direct rays of the Sun. The
                    air around the bulb will have less energy than the air around the thermometer
                    which is in direct sunlight, and the temperature will be less.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The thermometer that has the black paper around
                    it will have a higher temperature reading than the one with the white paper,
                    because black paper will absorb more energy and make the air around the bulb
                    hotter.

          <p>Before reading or going through the next
            paragraph, or when you are explaining this concept to learners, first ask the
            question "What sort of energy does the Sun give off?" The answer is light and
            heat energy. You can then go on to explain how the light energy given off by the
            Sun is used by the grass to make food and the energy is transferred from one
            organism to the next in the food chain. This ensures that you do not restrict
            the learners' view that the Sun gives off both light and heat energy.

        <p>In this food chain, the Sun gives off light
          energy which is used by the grass to make food. The grasshopper eats the grass.
          The mouse then eats the grasshopper and the energy is transferred (moved) from
          the grasshopper to the mouse. Lastly, the owl eats the mouse.
