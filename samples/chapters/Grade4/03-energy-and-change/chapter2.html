<p>Energy comes in many different forms and is all
around us.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Identifying energy all around us</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>There are many things we do daily that require energy. We get energy from food, so breakfast is an important meal. Movement requires energy
and in this picture some people are carrying some boxes, also using energy. There
are other kinds of energy in this picture too.</p>

<p>Learners need to know all these different kinds
of energy. There are bicycles, motor cars, motor bikes and an aeroplane and all
these kinds of transport need energy to move. Also there are electric lights on
the streets which give us the light we need.  There is sound energy coming from
the man playing a guitar, from people talking, from the traffic. A lady is sun
tanning on her roof and absorbing the Sun's energy. There are many activities
happening in this town. It is up to the teacher to ask as many open-ended
questions as possible to get learners to discuss the different uses of
energy.</p>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Look at the following picture.</li>
<li>Draw a circle around all the places where you think energy is
being used.</li>

</ol></div>

<p/>

<p>We saw in the activity that energy comes in many
different forms, such as light, heat, movement and sound energy. Let's take a
closer look at these different forms of energy.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title">Light</h3>
<p>Light is energy that travels in rays. Some of
these rays we can see, so we call that visible light. Some of the rays we cannot
see but we can feel their effect on us. We cannot see ultraviolet (UV) rays but
they burn our skin when we are in the Sun without sunblock. We can also not see
infrared rays but we can feel how hot they are on our skin.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0015.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Living things need light energy from the Sun to
survive.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Your body also needs sunlight to make Vitamin D
in your skin. Without Vitamin D your body cannot absorb calcium and your bones
cannot grow and get strong.</p>

<p/>

<p>Light comes from a light source. Anything that
produces light is called a source of light.</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The Sun is a source of light.</li>
<li>Stars are sources of light.</li>
<li>A fire is a source of light.</li>
<li>A candle is a source of light.</li>
<li>An electric bulb is a source of light.</li>
</ul><p/>
<div class="note" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The Moon may seem like a source of light, but it does not provide light like the
Sun. It only reflects the light from the Sun to us.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="activity" type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Having fun with shadows</h1>
<p>A shadow of an object forms when light cannot
pass through it. Let's see how many different and interesting shadows we can
make!</p>

<p>Do you enjoy standing outside on a warm summer
day and feeling the warmth from the Sun on your skin?  What about warming your
hands on a frosty cold morning in front of a fire? You are feeling heat! We
discussed that the Sun provides us with light, but it also provides us with
heat.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0017.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Look at these lions enjoying lying in the heat from the

<p>Heat can be found in many different places.
Anything that provides us with heat is a source of heat. Let's look more closely
at different sources of heat energy.</p>

<p>When objects are moving, they have movement.
The faster the object is moving, the more movement it has. Look at the examples
of movement below.</p>

<p>Did you know sound is also a type of energy?!
Sound is everywhere.</p>

<p/>

</div>

<p/>

<p>Sound is a special type of movement. Sound is
energy that makes substances vibrate. Sound travels as vibrations that we can
hear and sometimes even feel. All sounds are caused by vibration of
substances.</p>

<p>Energy is also stored in some sources. Stored
energy is the energy that is stored in our food, in petrol, in wood, oil and
other chemicals. Batteries also contain chemicals which are used to store
energy. This stored energy can be used for different purposes.</p>

<p/>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>When we eat food, the stored energy in the food can be used by
our bodies.</li>
</ol><figure><img src="images/gd-0026.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Energy is stored in food, such as eggs, which we eat for

<p>Energy can also be transferred (moved) from one
part of a system to another part.</p>

<p/>

<p>You must have heard of electricity before? We
use electricity every day in our modern lives. Electrical energy can be
transferred from a source to an appliance or light bulb.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" type="Questions"><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p>Write down some things which you think need
electricity in your life. <strong>\answerline{2}</strong></p>

              </div><div class="solution">
          
<p>anything from lights in the house, the stove,
the fridge, boiling the kettle, to using a hair dryer</p>

          </div></div></div></div>
</div>

<p/>

<p>Look at this picture of the light bulb below.
Electrical energy is transferred from a source to the light bulb to make it
glow.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0030.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A light bulb gives off light energy and heat energy.<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/satoru_kikuchi/4461604877/">
http://www.flickr.com/photos/satoru_kikuchi/4461604877/</a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Have you ever used a torch before? How do you
think the bulb lights up in the torch? The batteries are the source of energy in
the torch. When the torch is turned on, the energy is transferred from the
batteries to the bulb to make it light up so you can see in the dark.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0031.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">In a torch, energy is transferred from the batteries to
the bulb.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>This brings us to the next section. We can
think of the energy in the batteries of the torch as being the input energy and
the light energy that is given off by the bulb as the output energy.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Fireflies produce light using chemical energy
from their food! The light they give off is actually more efficient than that of
a light bulb.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title">Input and output energy</h2><div class="note" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>input energy</li>
<li>output energy</li>
<li>transferred</li>
</ul><p/>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Whenever anything happens, energy is transferred
from one component into another. People, machines and appliances need an energy
input to work. They also have an energy output that may be useful.</p>

<p/>

<p>Let's look at some examples.</p>

<p/>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>A girl is running a race. In order for the girl
to have energy, she needs energy from somewhere. Her input energy is the
chemical energy from the food that she ate. By running the race, she is giving
out energy in the form of movement energy and heat.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0032.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p>Example 2:</p>

<p>A TV will only work if it is plugged in. It
needs energy to work. While watching TV, electrical energy is the input and
light and sound is the output.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0033.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>A torch will not work when you turn it on unless
it has batteries. The input energy for the torch to work comes from the chemical
energy in the batteries which is changed to electrical energy.The output energy
from the torch is light and heat energy.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0034.jpg" width="300"/></figure><div class="section"><h3 class="title">Machines and appliances</h3>
<p/>

<p>We use lots of appliances in our lives. These
machines and appliances need input energy to make them work. This is usually
electrical energy. The output energy (the work the appliance or machine does) is
something that is useful to us.</p>

<p/>

<p>Let's look at some examples.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Investigating the input and output energy of
appliances</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>After going through this activity to identify
what the output energy is (and there are often more than one), go through the
appliances in which there are output energies which are incidental and not the
main purpose of the appliance. For example in a lamp, the main purpose is to get
light energy, but heat energy is also given off. Heat energy is the incidental
energy. many learners struggle to identify what the core phenomena are (the
output energy which is essential to the function of the appliance, such as light
energy in a lamp) and what the peripheral ones are. This activity presents an
ideal opportunity to start teaching some of these appliances. Once you have gone
through all the appliances, perhaps explain the concept with the lamp, as it is
easy to understand, and then go through the others and ask learners what the
essential output energy is that you want from the appliance and which are the
incidental ones which also occur. For example, with a drill the main, 
essential output is movement, and the peripheral, incidental output energies are
sound and heat energy. Another concept to note, which can be subtly introduced
at this point, is that in order to make an appliance energy efficient, you want
to minimise the energy conversion to the incidental energy output and maximise
the energy conversion to the essential energy output.</p>

<p>In summary, we can say that in appliances and machines, the input is normally electrical energy and the output depends on the
appliance:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Heat energy - from a geyser, stove, kettle, hair dryer</li>
<li>Sound energy - from a drill, vacuum cleaner, hair dryer</li>
<li>Light energy - from a lamp, torch</li>
<li>Movement - from an electric fan, drill</li>
</ul><p/></div><div class="note" data-type="keyconcepts"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Energy is all around us.</li>
<li>Energy can be moving in the form of light, heat, sound and moving
