        <p>This chapter leads on from the last in that it is
          taking movement energy further and looking at how movement energy produces sound
          energy in the form of the parts of the instrument that move and the vibrations
          which carry the sound energy.

          <strong>
            <u>NB</u>
          </strong>
          <strong>: A
            suggestion is to do the next chapter on "Energy and Sound" before this
            chapter on "Movement and energy in a system" instead of after it as stated in
            CAPS.
          </strong>
          There are many concepts in the chapter on "Energy and sound"
          which can be used when learners have to make a musical instrument in this
          chapter. Logically and conceptually, this does make more sense as sound is
          introduced as a form of energy in the previous chapter on "Energy around us" and
          then the chapter on "Energy and Sound" investigates sound further, before sound
          is applied to the use in musical instruments. This, however, is your choice as a
          teacher and as to how you would like to progress through the chapters.

          vibrates and causes a sound wave to occur. The sound is amplified (made louder)
          by the air vibrating in the hollow inside of the guitar as well. We can then
          easily hear the sounds produced by the guitar.

            <p>The idea of this activity is not to juxtapose
              the differences in the instruments between African and Western cultures. Rather, it aims to highlight the similarities between both cultures, such as similar instruments
              which are played in similar ways, but made from different materials. A
              suggestion here is to start this activity with a class discussion on what a
              culture is, how different learners perceive culture and what it means to them
              and to highlight the many cultures that we have in South Africa. Encourage
              learners to start expressing their opinions and ideas by asking direct
              questions. Then go on to do the activity below.

            <p>Learners need to research, design, make and
              evaluate a musical instrument. Examples they could consider include: guitar, pan
              pipes, whistles, flutes. The scene is set below with the Thunderbolt Kids
              needing to make musical instruments for a local festival. The emphasis is on
              indigenous instruments, although not limited to this. The learners should be
              encouraged to identify one of the characters to help to design and make an
              instrument following the Design Process.
            </p>
            
            <p>The educational value in Technology lies in the
              investigating, thinking and designing that children must do. Technology aims to
              make children capable; capability means the children's ability to turn thinking
              into <strong>doing</strong> and <strong>completing</strong>. When they learn new scientific knowledge, the
              learning has a purpose: they must use that knowledge in producing good designs.
              When they have made a product, they should be able to explain <strong>to you</strong> all the reasons why they designed it like that
              (even if they could not make it in the way they wanted to).
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Some very important learning happens during a
              Technology project, and you need to guide the learners through all the stages. If you
              trained as a technology teacher, you will recognise the NCS pattern of
              technology projects -- do you remember IDMEC? You can remind the learners of
              this:
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I stands for <strong>Investigating</strong> the problem which some people have,
              investigating existing products, and investigating concepts and skills that you
              will need to solve the problem.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              D stands for <strong>Designing</strong> -- that means using what you learnt from
              investigations to think of good ways to solve the problem.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              M stands for <strong>Making</strong> -- when you make your model, you use materials
              and tools, you make your model look good, and you show the teacher what you
              learnt in your investigating." (Notice that most <strong>children design with their hands</strong>, not only with pencil
              and paper. As they work with materials they get more ideas, and their design
              improves. So we should expect them to go back and forth between Designing and
              Making. It's really all the same stage of a project.)
            </p>
            
            <p>
              E stands for <strong>Evaluating</strong> -- after you have made your model to solve
              the problem, you have to ask, does it work? Is this what the people wanted?
              Could we make a better one?
            </p>
            
            <p>
              C stands for <strong>Communicating</strong> -- you must show other people how you
              decided on your solution to the problem. You need to write and draw your ideas."
              (The learners should be drawing and writing all through the project. Don't leave
              the writing to the end, because they find it boring at that stage. When they are
              getting new ideas they often enjoy writing because they are writing about their
              own ideas; this is a great strength of technology in school. A technology
              project gives the children reasons for reading and reasons for writing. And so -
              this is very important - we can address the literacy problem through the subject
              of science and technology.)

          <p>The Thunderbolt Kids want to participate in the
            local Arts Festival after the holidays. They want to make a band of four and
            participate in the section for indigenous bands. Any instruments used must be
            indigenous instruments which are handmade.
          </p>
          
          <p>The Thunderbolt Kids want a variety of different
            instruments. Sophie can play the flute so she would like an instrument which she
            can play by blowing, such as a whistle or pan pipes. Tom likes to play his
            electric guitar, but he can't use this as the instruments need to be traditional
            and handmade, so Tom needs an instrument which he can play by plucking strings.
            JoJo loves playing the drums and Farrah likes to dance with a shaker!

            an instrument to play. So you need to help one of them to design and make a

            <strong>DESIGN BRIEF:</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>You need to design and make an instrument for one
            of the Thunderbolt Kids. Write a design brief below where you identify which
            Thunderbolt Kid you are going to help and which type of instrument you are going
            to make.

          <hr/><hr/><p>
            <strong>INVESTIGATE:</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>The next step in the Design Process is to
            investigate and do some research about the instrument that you are going to
            make. You can use books and the internet to do your research. Perhaps you know
            someone who plays this instrument?
          </p>
          
          <p>We already looked at some instruments and what
            they are made from and how they are played.
          </p>
          
          <p>Answer these questions when doing research about
            your instrument:

          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
              <p>How do you play the instrument? </p><hr/></li>

            <li>
              <p>Is this instrument part of any culture and their traditional

              <hr/><hr/></li>
            <li>
              <p>What other interesting facts did you find out about this

          </ol><p>
            <strong>DESIGN:</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Now that you know a bit more about the
            instrument, you need to design how you are going to make your own.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Your instrument has the following
              specifications:
            </strong>
          </p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>It must make a sound by blowing on it or by plucking
              strings.
            </li>
            <li>You must be able to play at least two different sounds.</li>
          </ul><p>
            <strong>Your instrument has the following
              constraints:
            </strong>
          </p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>You must make it in class.</li>
          </ul><p>Answer these questions:</p>
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
              What shape and size will your instrument be?<hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></li>
            <li>

              What tools will you need to make it?<hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></li>
          </ol><p>Now you need to draw some designs for your
            instrument. Use scrap pieces of paper to do your first designs. Once you are
            happy with your design, use the space provided to draw your design. Label your
            drawing showing what materials you are going to use for the different
            parts.
          </p>
          
          <p>When you are making your instrument you might get
            better ideas to improve the sound. So come back afterwards and draw on the
            bottom half of the page; show what you really decided to make. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

            <strong>MAKE:</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Now make your instrument in class! After you have
            all finished making your instruments, take turns to play them for each other.
            Perhaps you can even form your own bands!
          </p>
          
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Once learners have finished making their
              instruments in class, go around and evaluate whether each learner's instrument

              to present their instrument, explain what it is, and then attempt to play two
              different sound. If time permits, you can break the class up into groups and
              they can form a band where they have to put together a song and then present it
              to the class.

          <p>Write a paragraph, where you tell the
            Thunderbolt Kid whom you decided to help, about the musical instrument that you
            made. Tell them what worked and what did not work, so that they can also learn
            from what you did and make a great instrument to play in their band!
