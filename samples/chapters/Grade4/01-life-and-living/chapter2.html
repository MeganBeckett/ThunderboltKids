              <strong>Introducing this topic</strong>
            </p>
            <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Learners need to identify different basic structures (parts) in plants.</li>
              <li>They need to explore VISIBLE differences between different plants.</li>
              <li>They can incidentally be introduced to the concept that plants make their own food; they don't eat other plants, but animals eat the food plants make which is stored in different parts of plants.</li>
              <li>At the start of this section it is suggested that you display propagation through cutting to compare to seedling propagation in a later activity. You can use a cut stem from a fig or rose plant.</li>
              <li>As an extension, they may be introduced to the function of different structures.</li>
              <li>In this series of textbooks, we will also place emphasis on the scientific method used to make and label drawings.</li>
            </ul><p>This section therefore starts with a study of plants and the different plant structures. Although CAPS does not directly require that the function of plant structures be studied, it is included to enrich the subsequent visual differentiation activities. Learners need to observe differences and find out more about the different types of plants in their environment. The differences can be the size of plants, the colour and form of the leaves and flowers, whether they have flowers or not, whether they lose their leaves or not - and many similar visible differences. We encourage teachers to ignite learners' curiosity and interest to find out how the natural world works. As young scientists, they need to compare plants or animals and group them together.</p>

              <strong>Presentation hints</strong>
            </p>
            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Always try to link learners' prior knowledge to what they are going to learn before you formally present the lesson.</li>
              <li>Bring a plant or a clear poster showing the basic structures of flowering plants to the class.</li>
              <li>Ask learners to identify different parts of the plant. Encourage them to think of the possible function(s) of each part. Many learners have the correct concepts but lack the linguistic proficiency to express their thoughts. Teachers are encouraged to help learners with language-related problems by providing a vocabulary rich environment and to display key words in a prominent place while constantly referring to these words. This supports learners to learn new scientific vocabulary and use it to explain themselves.</li>
              <li>Use questions to guide the class discussion regarding the basic structures of flowering plants. Why do plants need water? Which part of the plant can take up water? Give another word for "take up"(absorb). Which part of the plant connects the roots to the rest of the plant etc.</li>
              <li>Explain new words clearly and carefully and make sure these words (and possibly their meanings) are displayed in a prominent place in the class.</li>
              <li>Encourage learners to set up their own glossary with explanations of the meanings.</li>
            </ol></div>
          <p>All plants have different parts that we call structures. In most plants you can identify the following structures:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>roots</li>
            <li>stems</li>
            <li>leaves</li>
            <li>flowers</li>
          </ul><p>Let's take a look at the different plant structures.</p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Roots                </strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Plant roots are normally found underground. Roots have very important functions (jobs):</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>roots anchor the plant in the ground</li>
            <li>roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil, which are then transported to the rest of the plant</li>
            <li>some plants store the food they make in their roots, like potatoes or carrots. In Grade 5 you will see how plants make their own food!</li>
          </ul><figure><img src="../../img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0043.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0043.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">The roots of this tree go deep down into the soil.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="../../img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0044.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0044.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">A carrot is a stem that stores food made by the plant.</figcaption></figure><p>
            <strong>Stems                </strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Stems connect the roots to the rest of the plant. The stem has important functions:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the stem supports the leaves, flowers and fruit (the stem holds these parts upright)</li>
            <li>the stem carries nutrients and water from the roots to the other parts of the plant</li>
            <li>some plants store the food they produce in their stems (like sugar cane or asparagus)</li>
          </ul><figure><img src="../../img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0045.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0045.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">

            <strong>Leaves        </strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Although many plants' leaves are green, leaves can have many other colours. Some leaves change colour during autumn.</p>
          
          <p>Leaves have very important functions:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>leaves absorb sunlight and use it to make food for the plant</li>
          </ul><div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>This process is known as photosynthesis - learners are however not required to learn such specifics at this stage and will only learn about this in  Grade 5.</p>
          </div>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>some plants use their leaves to store water (cactus) or food (like spinach or lettuce).</li>
          </ul><div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Leaves have small openings (called stomata) underneath that allows the plant to pass out extra water as part of the process of transpiration</p>
          </div>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>most leaves have veins which are like tiny pipes that carry water and nutrients from the roots (the veins carry the food the leaf makes to the rest of the plant)</li>

            <strong>Flowers        </strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Many plants have flowers. The flowers are very important to the plant:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the flowers make pollen which is needed to make seeds from which new plants can grow</li>
            <li>flowers are often brightly coloured to attract birds and insects to spread their pollen and bring pollen from other flowers</li>
            <li>the flowers make fruit and seeds</li>
            <li>flowers come in many different shapes and sizes</li>

          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>In their fruit, like in peaches or oranges.</li>
            <li>In pods, like in beans and peas.</li>

          </ul><p>Other plants grow their seeds from the plant's flower, like a dandelion or the acorns on an oak tree.</p>
          
          <p>Seeds are very important to plants because new plants can grow from seeds.</p>

              <strong>Presentation hints</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>In the following activity learners will be required to label the drawing. This is the first time that the skill of labelling is being introduced in Grade 4, so it is important that teachers actively teach learners this important skill step by step, waiting for everyone to finish one step correctly before moving onto the next step. Perhaps the following rules could be made into a poster to be displayed and referred to whenever learners are asked to make scientific drawings...</p>
            
            <p>The guidelines for drawing and labelling:</p>
            <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The drawing must have a heading (printed in pen).</li>
              <li>Labeling lines must be in pencil.</li>
              <li>Labeling lines must be drawn using a ruler.</li>
              <li>Label lines must be parallel to the top / bottom of the page.</li>
              <li>Label lines must touch the part of the drawing being labeled.</li>
              <li>Label lines must end the same distance from the drawing (i.e. the labels must be in a vertical line underneath each other).</li>
              <li>Labels must be written using print, and not cursive, and in pen.</li>
              <li>The correct labels must be used in the correct place.</li>

            </p>
            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Look at the drawing below. There are no labels added to the drawing. Scientists often need to label drawings and diagrams. This is a very important skill!</li>
              <li>
                When we give labels for a drawing, there are some guidelines to follow:
                <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Draw a straight line with a pencil and ruler from the part that you want to label.</li>
                  <li>Label lines must touch the part of the drawing being labeled.</li>
                  <li>The line must be parallel to the bottom of your page.</li>
                  <li>Write the names for each part neatly underneath each other.</li>
                </ol></li>
              <li>Label the drawing of the flowering plant using these rules.</li>

            <p>You can start your own vegetable garden at home or at school and then bring your different crops to school to compare the differences in the food we eat!</p>
          </div>
          </aside><section class="maincontent span10"><div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>This section on plants provides an opportunity and a necessity to practise agricultural science as a part of Natural Science. For example, while doing this section, encourage your learners to plant different kinds of crops (those that store food in stems, leaves, in roots, etc) and then ask them to bring them to school once they have grown to compare the visible differences and work with them fresh from the soil. If no one can grow their own vegetables, try to set up a vegetable garden at the school in some corner, or just buy some different vegetables from the shops and bring them to class so learners can see the real things and describe the differences. This aspect may not have been highlighted in the curriculum, but it is important for learners to know where food comes from. And also highlight the need for schools to have vegetable gardens!</p>
          </div>
          <p>There are many different kinds of plants. If you look at different plants you can see many things that are different but also things that are the same. We know that most plants have stems, roots and leaves, and that many others have flowers, seeds and fruit. If we want to compare plants, we can compare these plant structures.</p>
          
          <p>You can look at the different structures of plants and compare their:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>size</li>
            <li>colour</li>
            <li>shape</li>
          </ul><p>Or you can ask really important questions about the plants, like:</p>

The basil plant has a thin green stem while the banana palm has a thick brown woody bark covering a it's very thick trunk.</p>

              <p>This question is specifically left open to the learners' interpretation and once everyone in the class has finished, teachers should discuss the differences and similarities the learners saw.

                    <p>NO - Just because you cannot see seeds does not mean the plant does not produce seeds sometime in its lifetime. Some plants only flower once in 10 - 15 years and then only produce seeds at this time. Teachers should emphasise that just because at a specific time a plant does not have flowers or seeds, learners should not assume that the plant does not produce these.</p>

              <strong>Introducing the next activity</strong>
            </p>
            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
                Ask the learners <em>before the next lesson</em> to bring leaf samples of THREE different plants to the class. They need to know the names of the plants.
              </li>
              <li>Tell learners to be respectful of plants and plant owners. If the plant does not belong to them they need to ask permission from its owner to collect a leaf. They also need to be careful not to ruin the plant when they cut the leaf off; use a pair of scissors or cutters. </li>
              <li>
                Learners must also take care of themselves. Some plant are POISONOUS. Safety rules are:
                <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Don't eat parts of unknown plants.</li>
                  <li>Don't rub your eyes while handling plants.</li>
                  <li>Wash your hands after handling plants.</li>
                </ul></li>
              <li>Let the learners name edible leaves for example: lettuce, spinach, parsley, cabbage, coriander etc.</li>
              <li>As teacher you need to contribute to the activity the learners are going to do by also bringing samples of leaves of different plants to the class to make sure that a variety of examples are available.</li>
              <li>Let the learners study the activity. Make sure that they understand how to trace and label the leaves.</li>
              <li>Explain key words such as: smooth or serrated edge, large or small, hairy or smooth, thin or thick, etc. </li>
              <li>Let the learners work in pairs. Each pair has to complete the table in the activity. </li>
              <li>Give the learners enough time to complete the activity. Walk around the class and make sure that all the learners remain on task. Help the learners who are struggling.</li>
              <li>Ask the learners for their answers and fill in the table on the board.</li>
              <li>Ask the learners to complete the self assessment. </li>

            <strong>Introducing this topic</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>This unit deals with the basic structure of animals and thus their body plans. CAPS does not differentiate between vertebrate or invertebrate, between warm-blooded or cold-blooded or any other groupings. It requires that learners compare animals based on the basic structure of animals: head, tail, body and limbs. Comparisons are based on these structural elements as well as size, shape, body covering and sense organs. Teachers are cautioned to stick to these specifications but encouraged to extend able learners by introducing such concepts as vertebrate and invertebrate, warm and cold blooded, etc.</p>

          </p>
          
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Introduce this unit with a class discussion. Ask the learners to think of different animals. They can whisper their animal's name in your ear before miming the animal to the class to guess which animal they are.</li>
            <li>Discuss the concept that humans are also animals. It is important to address language barriers and misconceptions at this point. If their mom for instance says that the big sister lives in a pig sty or that the big brother eats like a dog then this is a different way to use language. This point is perhaps an absurd example but it is important to be on the look-out for similar misconceptions where colloquial (or everyday) and scientific language use leads to misunderstanding of scientific principles.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Presentation:</strong> Revise the concept <em>basic structure</em> (how it is built up). Let learners name the basic structure of plants. Study the basic body structure of different animals. Use the 5 basic body structures as guidelines. (Many teachers choose to use the word <em>body plan</em> to describe the structure  of the bodies of animals however this is not strictly in keeping with terminology used in the CAPS.)

Discuss the body of different animals starting with themselves and then use the jellyfish and the dog as examples.

          <p>Just like plants, animals also have a basic structure. The basic structure of an animal is:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>head</li>
            <li>tail</li>
            <li>body</li>
            <li>limbs</li>
            <li>sense organs</li>
          </ul><p>
            <strong>Head</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Most animals have a part of their body that we call the 'head'. Even the smallest animal has a part where it's 'brain' is. In most animals the head has:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>abrain (or brain-like structure) - no matter how small</li>
            <li>sensory organs (like the eyes and ears)</li>
            <li>feeding structures (like the mouth and jaws)</li>
          </ul><p>
            <strong>Tail</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Most animals have a tail at the back end of their body (have you ever wondered where a starfish or octopus' tail is?) A tail is often pointed but can have many other shapes as well.</p>

          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>move and swing in trees - monkeys for example.</li>
            <li>balance - kangaroos use their tails to balance while they jump for example.</li>
            <li>kill their prey - crocodiles use their tails to spin them around and around when they need to drown their prey; scorpions often have poison in their tails.</li>
            <li>pat down the earth - beavers use their powerful tails to pat ground down hard and solid.</li>
            <li>swim - almost all fish use their tails to let them swim.</li>
            <li>steer their movement - fish, whales, dolphin, sharks and many others use their tail as a sort of rudder to steer them in a certain direction. Birds' tails are very important rudders too.</li>
            <li>keep it warm - a little squirrel or fox wraps its tail around it like a blanket to keep warm!</li>
            <li>chase away flies - a cow or horse can swish their tail to get rid of flies.</li>
            <li>warn others of possible dangers - some deer flash the white underside of their tails to other deer to warn them of possible danger.</li>
            <li>communicate - dogs show their emotion in their tails. If they are happy to see you they wag their tails. A burglar is not always met with the same wagging tail!</li>
            <li>protect - an armadillo has an armoured tail to protect itself. They can roll up into the ball, with their tail protecting them.</li>
            <li>distract predators - if a lizard is attacked it will drop its tail and get away while the predator goes after the wriggling tail.</li>
