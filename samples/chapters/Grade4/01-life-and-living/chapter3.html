            <strong>Sunlight</strong>
          </p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Plants need sunlight to grow and live.</li>
            <li>Green plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide gas to make food.</li>
            <li>The plant can use some of this food to grow and develop.</li>
            <li>It stores the rest of the food, which animals can eat.</li>
            <li>When animals and humans eat plants they get energy from the plant.</li>
          </ul><figure><img src="../../img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0091.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0091.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">The plant leaf uses sunlight energy to make food and grow. The caterpillar eats the leaf.</figcaption></figure><p>
            <strong>Air</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Just like animals and people, plants also need air to live and grow. Plants use carbon dioxide to make food so that they can grow.</p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Water</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Plants need water to grow and to make food. Some plants need more water than others. The amount of water a plant needs depends on the type of plant. If the plant does not get the amount of water it needs it will die. Some plants are able to grow in very dry areas, such as cacti in the desert. These plants have adapted (changed) over many, many years to be able to survive in these conditions.</p>
          
          <p>The roots of the plant absorb water from the soil. This water carries nutrients from the soil to all the parts of the plant. In the picture, the raindrops are collecting on the leaves. They will then fall down to the ground and soak into the soil. The roots will then absorb the water for the plant.</p>
          
          <p>Remember: a plant needs water, sunlight and carbon dioxide to make food.</p>

            <strong>Soil</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Most plants grow well if they are planted in soil.</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Plants are anchored in the soil by their roots.</li>
            <li>Their roots absorb the dissolved nutrients from the soil.</li>
            <li>To make sure plants get enough of these mineral nutrients we often add some fertiliser or compost to the soil. We say that soil that has a lot of nutrients is rich and soil that does not have many nutrients is poor.</li>

            <strong>How to introduce the topic</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>It is recommended to do this practical task over time at school while learners engage with the next section. Give the learners the opportunity to observe the wonder of a new plant becoming alive from a seed or cutting! Let them DO the investigations;  observe and record observations over time.</p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Presentation hints</strong>
          </p>
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
              Prior experience of the teacher will assure success. Do the prescribed investigations <strong>before</strong> you ask learners to do them. Then you will be more able to guide the learners. Consider not to do this investigation in mid-winter alow temperatures are usually not favourable for germination. Use different bean seeds and find out which germinate better. Apply the precautions as stated in the investigation in the text.
            </li>
            <li>Start a class discussion by asking learners why plants are important. Possible answers can be: for food, to provide oxygen, to protect the soil (plant on dunes), plants are beautiful etc. Do we need to make more plants? Why? How?</li>
            <li>Check learners' understanding of the words:  germinate - a seed develops into a new plant, cutting a stem, leaf or part of a plant that can be used to grow a new plant.</li>
            <li>Tell the learners that they need to find out what seeds need to germinate and grow into new plants. Go through the materials and procedures in the text. Let them work in groups. Check that every learner has the required materials and knows what to do.</li>
            <li>You must monitor DAILY how their investigations progress. Set aside at least five minutes  per day. </li>
            <li>Guide the learners on how to keep a diary. Learners have to write the date and record their observations under headings as: what is different today (root appeared), measured root length, etc.</li>
            <li>
              Revise/reinforce that drawings and labeling must be done scientifically:
              <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the drawing must have a heading (printed in pen)</li>
                <li>the drawing must be done with a sharp pencil</li>
                <li>the drawing must be done using solid lines</li>
                <li>labelling lines must be in pencil</li>
                <li>labelling lines must be drawn using a ruler</li>
                <li>labelling lines must be parallel to the top / bottom of the page</li>
                <li>labelling lines must touch the part of the drawing being labelled</li>
                <li>labelling lines must end the same distance from the drawing (i.e. the labels must be in a vertical line underneath each other)</li>
                <li>labels must be printed in pen</li>
              </ul></li>
          </ol><p>The correct labels must be used in the correct place.</p>
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
              Assist the learners to make the following drawings:
              <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the bean and the first root</li>
                <li>the bean, root and first leave</li>

          <h3 class="title">What seeds need to germinate</h3>
          <section class="maincontent span10"><p>You have learnt that seeds are important to grow new plants. A plant needs to germinate from the seed to start growing. This means that the seed has to develop into a new plant and grow all the necessary plant parts.</p>
          
          <p>In the first chapter of this term, we germinated a seed and saw that although it seemed to be non-living, it can be revived.</p>
          
          <p>Have you ever wondered what seeds need to germinate and grow into new plants? Let's find out by doing a scientific investigation!</p>
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>This is the first time learners will be doing a scientific investigation. Emphasise the need for a proper scientific investigation to answer a question, such as "Can a bean germinate in a dark place?", "Can a bean germinate in a very cold place?", "Can a bean germinate without water?", etc. Each group can answer a different question and their aim and prediction will depend on what question they are answering.</p>

            </p>
            
            <p>An aim in a science investigation is where we state what the purpose (aim) of the investigation is. What do you want to find out by doing this investigation? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

              <strong>PREDICTION:</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>A prediction is when you predict (make a guess) what the result of your investigation will be. But it is not just any guess! You must think about what you expect will happen in your investigation. What do you think will happen to your seed and how will it change? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

              <strong>NB! A control is where the bean seed is given everything that we think it needs to germinate. In the other investigations, one of these things will be left out.</strong>
            </p>
            <div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>It is important to have a control to compare the other groups to. The control beans should germinate and grow the best and you can then use these plants to monitor further. Once they have germinated, show learners how to measure the lengths of the stems using a ruler. Possibly measure 3 stems and then calculate an average. Record these results on the board and then use them to draw a table and then a graph in the learners book. Get all learners to make a drawing of the first beans that germinated, and again when a leaf appears. there is space later on to do these drawings.</p>

            <div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>For this section, collect all the results from all groups. A suggestion is to have "the diary" written up as a table on the board and each day you record the results for each group. The groups must look at all the different investigations taking place, otherwise those who are studying, for example, the beans with no water will have a boring time. The skills of observation are very important here. You can teach some of these skills about how to collect and record data. The plants in the control group should be measured each day, once they have germinated so you can record the growth. Measure the length of three stems and calculate an average using, average = total length of 3 stems/3. You can then use these results to plot a graph to show growth over time.</p>

A table is very useful in science investigations to record and present a lot of data. A table must also have a heading!

              <p>A possible outline of a table is given below. Depending on how much the beans grew, use millimetres or centimetres and include the unit of measurement in the column heading. Remember to give the table a heading! Also explain to learners why you have not recorded all the lengths of the stems, but only an average. This may be difficult at this point but it is an important science concept for later. Averages are used as they give a better representation of the whole experiment (or population). If you only chose one plant to measure, that plant might have not grown much or grown much more than the other plants and so this would not be a true reflection of the results.</p>

              We are now going to draw a graph! Graphs are another way of presenting (showing) our results. They are often used by scientists to show their results. Drawing graphs is a very important skill! We will use the results from the table above to draw a graph. There are also many different types of graphs, but we will draw a line graph to show the growth of the seedlings each day. If this is the first time you are drawing a graph, do not worry! Your teacher will help you. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

                <li>Next decide what will go on each axis. The horizontal axis is where the independent variable is plotted. This is confusing for learners, even in Grade 12, so the earlier we start showing them how to do it, the better. The date or day number will go along the horizontal axis. The dependent variable goes on the vertical axis. the height grown by the plants (stem length) is dependent on the day, so this goes on the vertical axis.</li>
                <li>Label the axes.</li>
                <li>Next decide on a scale for each - perhaps only record a measurement every two days if your seeds took a long time to grow.</li>
                <li>Next plot each point using the "pairs" from the table. In other words for Day 1, the height should be zero so plot a point for this first. Show learners how to first read on one axis, then the other, and where these two cross, you make the point.</li>

              <li>Which materials are needed?</li>
              <li>How are you going to do the experiment? How many millilitres of water will you use for "a little water" and how many for "plenty of water"? Are you going to add the water daily or every second day?  </li>
            </ul><p>Do the investigation:</p>
            <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Follow procedures 1-5 in text.</li>
              <li>Collect and record your data (points 6 and 7). Draw a graph using the collected data.</li>
