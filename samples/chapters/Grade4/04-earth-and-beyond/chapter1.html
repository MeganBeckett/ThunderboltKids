          <strong>NB.</strong> The last section in this strand is on the Moon. The order has been changed slightly compared to CAPS so that you do not run out of time at the end of the year to do the Design Activity on modelling a rocket as some important skills will be learnt in this. However, if you would like to stick to the order in CAPS, then do so. The chapter on the Moon requires learners to do a Moon watch where they observe and record the changing shape of the light on the Moon for at least a month. Bear this in mind during the 4th term as you will need to start this activity a month before you get to the Moon chapter so that it is completed in time.

          <p>Remind the learners that the Earth looks flat or level to us if we look around outside. Now ask them to imagine what the Earth would look like if they went high, very high.  Many of them have seen images of the Earth as a ball, photographed from spacecraft. They will tell you, "That is the Earth." But they may have difficulty if you ask them to show you where they are on the Earth at this moment. It is not because they do not know the continents - their problem is making the mental shift between being in Space and being on the Earth. For that reason we spend some time in this Unit developing their ability to look at things from a different point of view. This is a mental ability that normally develops when children are about 10 or 11, and as teachers we can ensure that it does develop for these learners.</p>

          <p>Plants grow in soil. The soil comes from rock that was deep under the ground. Rain washes soil away and it exposes the rock. We say that the rain erodes the soil and the rock as it breaks little pieces off and washes it away.</p>
          
          <p>As the rain erodes the surface of the Earth it makes features, such as hills and valleys, rivers and seas. Look at the following pictures showing the different features of Earth's surface.</p>

          <section class="maincontent span10"><p>What we have seen in this activity is that as you go higher and higher up, the objects appear smaller and smaller. So, when photographs are taken from an aeroplane or helicopter, we get a better idea of the features of the Earth's surface and we can see more. If we go even higher up and up and up into space then we can't go in an aeroplane anymore. Then astronauts fly up in a spacecraft. In the picture below you see what South Africa looks like to people in a spacecraft high above South Africa.</p>

            We saw that Earth is shaped like a ball. Something that is shaped like a soccer ball is called a <strong>sphere</strong>. We see the shape of Earth when we go very high and get far away from it, for example an astronaut in a spaceship can see the shape of Earth when looking out the window of the spaceship and back at Earth.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            If we look out of the classroom window, the Earth looks flat, not ball-shaped. Many people long ago believed that the Earth is flat, because it <strong>looks</strong> flat. It is so big that we can't see that it is curved.
          </p>
          
          <p>Pretend you are an ant on a soccer ball. You are so small that the ball looks flat. You can't see the other side of the ball, and you can't see that it is a ball. Look at the picture of the ant on the soccer ball. All the ant can see is a flat surface. He does not even know he is on a round ball because it is so much bigger than he is!</p>
