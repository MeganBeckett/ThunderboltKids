<p>Remember when we looked at the features of the Earth. Now, let's take a look at the features of the Moon. Let's go visit the Moon! You already built rockets in class. Now let's pretend that we are the astronauts on our rockets and we are going to explore the Moon.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title">The Moon is a ball of rock in Space</h3>
<p/>

<p>The Moon is very different to the Earth. The Moon is not a planet either! It is made of rock and it moves around the Earth in a circle. Remember how we spoke about the planets which orbit the Sun. The Moon does the same thing - it orbits around the Earth.</p>

<p>Moon facts:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The Moon is 384 000 kilometres from Earth.</li>

<li>The Moon has no air and no water.</li>

<p/>

<p>In 1969, the rocket you see in the picture carried three men to the Moon for the first time. The rocket and spacecraft were called Apollo 11.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0051.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption"><p>This picture shows the rocket blasting off and going up into Space. The rocket is as high as a 30-storey building.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p/>
<div class="note" data-type="visit">
<p>Watch this video of astronauts landing on the Moon. <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/videos/space/moonlanding.html">http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/videos/space/moonlanding.html</a></p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The flame at the back is the hot gases coming out of the nozzle. The clouds on the side of the picture are the gases that hit the ground and blow dust sideways. The three men were called astronauts. They were in a small spacecraft on the nose of the rocket.</p>

<p/>

<p>The big rocket burned up all its fuel and fell back to Earth, and landed in the sea. But the small spacecraft went on by itself to the Moon, and the astronauts were inside the spacecraft.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0052.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption"><p>This is the spacecraft that went to the Moon and landed there.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p><strong>Let us imagine that we are in that rocket!</strong></p>

<p>We travel through Space at 5 800 kilometres in every hour. After three days' travel, we reach the Moon. We can see that the Moon is round, like a ball. We can see that the surface is rough, with mountains and many craters.</p>

<p/>

<p>The surface is the outside of an object. You can rub your hand on the surface of your desk. A crater is a hole that was caused by something hitting a surface. If you throw a stone into sand, you make a crater in the sand.</p>

<p/>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>First, let the children try to read this story for themselves. You can prepare them by doing the following.</p>

<p>Ask them to find these words and underline them:</p>

<p>surface (the ground is the surface of the Earth),</p>

<p>helmet (a structure that protects a person's head - worn by cyclists),</p>

<p>radio (a system like a cellphone),</p>

<p>crater (a hole in the ground),</p>

<p>protective glass (glass that stops the Sun harming your eyes), and</p>

<p>temperature (how hot or cold something is).</p>

<p>Then explain the meaning of the words to the learners.</p>

<p>If you decide to read the story to the learners, then pause at each of these words, and ask the class to read the word aloud. This does two things: it helps them learn the new word in its context, and it lets you know that they are following in the text.</p>
</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title">What do we find on the Moon?</h3>
<p>Read this story, or listen while your teacher reads it aloud:</p>

<p/>

<p>The spacecraft goes down slowly to the Moon's surface, blowing out a big cloud of dust. There is no air on the Moon, and so the dust quickly falls back to the ground. We put on our spacesuits. We have air in tanks to breathe, radios to talk to each other and special glass helmets to protect our eyes from the Sun.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0053.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption"><p>An astronaut in his spacesuit walking on the Moon.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>The ground under our feet is grey sand, dust and small rocks.</p>

<p/>

<p>The craters that we saw are big holes in the surface of the Moon. Rocks that travel very fast through Space sometimes smash into the Moon. In the places where the rocks hit, they make a hole and a ring of sand.</p>

<p/>

<p>The sky is black, not blue. We can see the stars and the Sun at the same time. The Sun is bright, much brighter than on Earth, and we are glad we have protective glass in our helmets.</p>

<p/>

<p>As we walk around on the Moon, the temperature of the ground is hotter than boiling water. But if we stop in the shade of a big rock or the spacecraft, the temperature is much colder than ice. The temperature changes so much because the Moon has no air. On Earth, the air keeps the Earth's surface from getting too hot or too cold.</p>

<li>shape</li>

</ul><p/>
</div>
<p/>

<p>A phase is a period of time. For example, you are now in the Intermediate Phase at school. In Grade 7 you will be in the Senior Phase.</p>

<p/>

<p>As the Moon orbits around the Earth, it appears as though the Moon is changing its shape in the sky. The Moon changes from a thin crescent to a full circle or disk (full moon) and then it shrinks back to a thin crescent again. It is then not visible for a few days again. These changes in the Moon's shape are called the Moon's phases.</p>

<p/>

<p>Look at the diagram showing all the phases of the Moon.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gd-0055.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p>The Moon moves in an orbit around the Earth. The Moon takes about 29\(\frac{1}{2}\) days to go all the way around and come back to the same position. This length of time is almost one month and so it takes almost one month from a full Moon to the next full Moon.</p>

<p/>

<p>The Moon changes shape each night as the Earth is casting a shadow on the Moon. Depending on the position of the Moon, the Earth and the Sun, the Earth blocks the Sun's light from reaching the Moon and therefore casts a shadow. As the Moon moves around the Earth different shadows will be cast on the Moon from the Earth making it look like it is changing shape.</p>

<div class="section"><h3 class="title">Why does the Moon change shape during the month?</h3>
<p>The Sun shines on the Moon but there is always a part of the Moon that the Sun cannot reach. We can see the part that has sunlight on it, but we cannot see the dark part that is in shadow.</p>

<p/>

<p>Once upon a time the Sun and the Moon were married and they had many children known as Stars.</p>

<p/>

<p>The Sun was very fond of his children and he always wanted to hold them. But he was very hot and so the stars got burnt.</p>

<p/>

<p>The stars did not like to be burnt and so they always ran away to hide when he came up into the sky. But the stars liked to be with their mother, the Moon, because she was the cool one. The Moon had markings on her face and she was beautiful.</p>

<p/>

<p>This made the Sun very jealous, and he was angry with the Moon. So that is the reason why the Sun chases the Moon out of the sky. On some days you can see her in the daytime but the Sun almost never catches her.</p>

<p/>

<p>There are times when the Moon comes between the Sun and the Earth, and we see the Sun go dark. These events are called eclipses of the Sun.<em/><em/></p>
