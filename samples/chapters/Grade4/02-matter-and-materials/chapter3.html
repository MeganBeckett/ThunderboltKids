        <section class="maincontent span10"><p>What did we learn from doing this activity? Materials can be made stronger by changing their shape. An example is rolling the paper into pillars. Pillars can be circular, triangular or square. Which one do you think is the strongest?</p>
        
        <p>Tom has a pile of books next to his bed at home. He wants to make a stand for these books so that his room looks a bit neater. He thought about making a stand using materials he can easily get hold of, such as paper. His idea is to make 4 pillars and then place a cardboard sheet on top on which to place his books. But, Tom does not know which type of pillar would be the strongest - triangular, circular, or square.</p>
        
        <p>Let's help Tom and do an investigation to find out which shape of pillar is the strongest for him to make a book stand.</p>
        
        <div class="teachers-guide">
          <p>Teacher note: For this investigation the class can divided into three groups. Each group folds the paper to form a different shaped pillar.</p>
          
          <p>Group 1: Circular pillars</p>
          
          <p>Group 2: Triangular pillars</p>
          
          <p>Group 3: Square pillars.</p>
          
          <p>Each group will investigate only the strength of their pillar.</p>
          
          <p>The conclusion will be made when the results of all groups are put together.</p>
          
          <p>To make the investigation a fair test, each group must use the same :</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>size and type of paper</li>
            <li>identical books</li>
            <li>platform</li>
            <li>amount of sticky tape</li>
          </ul><p>Explain this to the learners while doing the experiment - it would not be a fair test if each group used different paper and different weights of books. In the experimental design stage, encourage learners to ask questions such as "How will we know it is strong?", "What should we do to check it is strong?", etc. This will help learners to see that by placing books on top with increasing weight, you can test how strong the pillars are. Do not give them these answers outright, rather ask them the questions first and encourage them to think.</p>

          <strong>Tubing and Folding</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>Materials are strengthened by shaping them into a tube (tubing).</p>
        
        <p>Tubing is often used to make frames and for supporting weight. The tube can be in a number of shapes, as we saw in the investigation. It can be circular, square, triangular or even in a U-shape.</p>

Corrugated cardboard and bubble wrap plastic are examples of strengthened folded materials .</p>
        
        <p>Corrugated iron is another example of how folding makes a material stronger. Look at the picture below of a sheet of corrugated iron and a flat sheet. Corrugated iron is much stronger which is why it is used for the roofs of some houses.</p>
