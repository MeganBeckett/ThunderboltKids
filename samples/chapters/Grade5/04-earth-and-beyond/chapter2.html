        <p>Chapter 2 deals with the rocky crust of the Earth; we aim to teach the children where soil comes from: soil is broken-down rock plus organic matter from plants and animals. However, we can't just teach about the crust because that would leave a hanging question - the crust of what? So we spend a little time looking at what the crust is covering, and so we look at the structure of the Earth.</p>

              Geomorphology is the study of the Earth's surface features. If you break the word up it is easier to understand: <em>geo-</em> (earth), <em>-morph-</em> (shape), <em>-ology</em> (study of).

              The purpose of this drawing task is to make learners grapple with the idea that they are on a ball-shaped Earth. Most learners have no problem with saying that the Earth is shaped like a ball and most have seen pictures of the ball-shaped Earth like <strong>Figure 1</strong>. However, this concept is not easy to think about when you are actually standing on the ball. So the question, "what would you find if you could dig a hole right through the ball?", makes them move mentally between the ground they can see and the view of the ball-shaped Earth as seen from Space.

                    Look at the learners' drawings but do not correct them. If you give them the right answer, you will stop them thinking about the problem. At the end of the chapter they will get a chance to change their ideas - see <u>Activity:</u><u> So what is under our feet?</u>

                  <p>Some learners' drawings might show the hole going down through soil and rocks and underground water and volcanoes. Other learners' drawings might not show any of these things; it depends on how much general knowledge they have by Gr. 5.

The deepest part of all the oceans is here. It is a trench (like a valley with steep sides) that is 11 kilometres deep. In fact, the trench is so deep that the light from the Sun cannot reach the bottom, leaving it pitch-dark.

            If we go deeper than the crust, we go into rock called the <strong>mantle</strong>. The mantle is the layer that lies underneath the crust. Mantle rock is much hotter than the rock that is found in the crust. The rocks are so hot that they are soft in some places, like toothpaste. The hot rock pushes upwards against the crust. Where there is a weak spot in the crust, the hot rock might burst through. This is how volcanoes erupt. The mantle is 2 900 km thick, so it is still a long way to go down to get to the core.

          </aside><section class="maincontent span10"><p>We know that we can break big stones into smaller stones. But when we see small stones lying on the ground, it is hard to think how they were broken up.</p>
          
          <p>In nature, rocks break up in many ways. We  will look at just three of those ways.</p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>1. Bigger rocks break up into smaller rocks</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Over time, rocks can get cracks in their surface. Water gets into the cracks and causes these cracks to get bigger. Pieces of rock then break off when the cracks get bigger. Smaller and smaller pieces of rock form as the rocks breakup more and more.</p>
          
          <figure><a class="lightbox" href="images/gd-0025.jpg"><img src="../../img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0025.jpg"/></a><noscript><img src="images/gd-0025.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">Can you see the cracks forming in this rock to make smaller and smaller pieces of rock?</figcaption></figure><p>
            <strong>2. Water breaks up the surface of rocks</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Soil contains a little water. The roots of plants can change this water so that the water becomes an acid. Vinegar is an example of an acid that we use in our everyday lives.</p>
          
          <p>Acid can work on stones to break them up. The acidic water breaks the surface of the stone and then the stone can break more easily.</p>
          
          <p>Rain water can also break up and wear down the surface of stones causing small pieces to break off. We saw an example of this with the water from the tap breaking up the cement.</p>
          <figure><a class="lightbox" href="images/gd-0026.jpg"><img src="../../img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0026.jpg"/></a><noscript><img src="images/gd-0026.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">Rain wears down rocks and causes smaller pieces to break off.</figcaption></figure><p>
            <strong>3. Stones rub together, and their surfaces break up</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Stones rub together when water moves them, or when wind blows them against bigger stones. People and animals walking on a path kick stones and break off little pieces. Small stones become even smaller, and eventually the very small pieces become sand.</p>

          <p>When you see insects in the compost column, they could come from two places. They may be fruit flies that can get in through the air holes, but they may also be hatching from eggs that insects laid in the peels and leaves before you put them into the plastic bottles. Do you remember in the first term when we did Life and Living, we observed the life cycle of fruit flies?</p>
          
          <p>After about 4 weeks, your compost will be a dark colour and the big pieces will have broken down into small pieces. You can pour out the compost and mix an equal amount of sand with the compost. Now you have made a little soil.</p>
          
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Real soil is more complex than this mixture, and the living things in the soil make substances that bind the grains of sand together, or break down the grains into smaller pieces. But for Gr. 5, it is enough to help the learners understand that soil is not just sand.</p>

            <p>When introducing microorganisms, start off with a discussion about them and ask learners whether they think microorganisms are living or not.</p>
          </div>
          <p>When you looked at soil, you found sand grains, small bits of plants and small bits of animals. But there was another group of things you could not see, because they are too small. They are microorganisms. They are living things that, in the soil, change dead plant and animal material into substances that plants can use and absorb through their roots.</p>

            If we work hard, we can make a small amount of good topsoil in a term. But a farmer needs good topsoil all over the farm. Nature works all over the Earth but it works very slowly. Nature needs about 1 000 years to make topsoil just 10 cm deep. If rain washes away the topsoil the farmer cannot grow good crops on that land. When the topsoil has been lost due to wind or rain, we say <strong>erosion</strong> has taken place. Look at the picture below.

            </figcaption></figure><p>Even if the farmer stops the erosion, it will be about 1 000 years before nature can make new topsoil to replace the soil that has been lost.</p>
          
          <p>If there is too little topsoil, then there will be too few plants for animals to eat. This means that all animals depend on the topsoil, even animals like lions that only eat meat.</p>

              <p>Lions eat other animals, such as impala, zebra, giraffe, etc. These animals are herbivores which eat grass and other plants. The plants that these animals eat need topsoil to grow in. So the lions are indirectly dependent on topsoil by their feeding relationships.</p>

          <section class="maincontent span10"><p>As we saw previously, different soil samples collected from different places have different size particles. Imagine running along the beach and feeling the sand beneath your feet. Now imagine running through a forest over the soil. Can you see there are big differences in these types of soil?</p>
          
          <p>The mixture of particles and the size of particles determines the soil type. There are 3 different types of soils:</p>
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Clay</li>
            <li>Loam</li>
            <li>Sand</li>
          </ol><p>Let's look at the characteristics of the soil types.</p>

            <strong>Sandy soil</strong> is the soil you find at the beach. It consists of large gritty particles and very tiny bits of rock which we call grains of sand. The grains of sand are coarse and the soil is loose.
          </p>
          
          <p>Can you see how, in the picture of sandy soil, the grains can fall though your hand? It does not retain fertilisers. It is easily washed or blown away. On sunny days sandy soil warms up quickly. Most plants do not grow well in sandy soil.</p>

            Have you ever made a pot out of <strong>clay</strong>? If you are lucky enough to have done this or seen someone do it, you will know a bit about the properties of clay.
          </p>
          
          <p>Clay can be moulded. This is because it consists mainly of very fine particles which cling together. Clay becomes sticky when wet. It retains fertilisers for a very long time. Clay is not easily blown or washed away. It does not become as warm as sandy soil.</p>

            <strong>Loam</strong> is a very funny word! But this is also a type of soil. Loam is actually a mixture of clay, sand and humus. Humus is organic material from plants and animals which is decomposing.
          </p>
          
          <p>Loam is fairly loose and fertile. It retains fertilisers longer than sandy soil. It is not easily blown or washed away. It is much cooler than either sand or clayey soil. Loam soil is the best type of soil for plants to grow in!</p>

          <section class="maincontent span10"><p>Now that we have looked at how different soil types hold different amounts of water, let's compare how well plants grow in the different soil types. You might have grown seedlings before, in Life and Living, but let's do it again. This time we will focus on the type of soil.</p>

              <li>packet of radish seeds</li>
              <li>some sand, enough to fill one tin</li>
              <li>some loam soil, enough to fill a tin. You can find loam soil in a vegetable garden</li>
              <li>some clay soil, enough to fill the last tin (if you have access to clay soil)</li>
              <li>a ruler</li>
              <li>a measuring cup</li>

            </ul><div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>We use radish seeds because they germinate very quickly. Also, they are so small that they soon need substances from the soil to continue growing. In the tin with sand, they will not get those substances and they will soon begin to die. In the loam soil, your learners may get several good radishes. A radish is a root vegetable that has a sharp hot taste. If you cannot find clay soil, then just do the investigation using sand and loam soil which are easier to obtain.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>METHOD:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Make five small holes in the bottom of each tin, so that water can drain out if there is too much water in the tin.</li>
              <li>Fill one tin with sand, one tin with the loam soil, and the last tin with clay soil.</li>
              <li>Plant 10 radish seeds in each tin. Cover the seeds by sprinkling a little of the sand or soil over them.</li>
              <li>Pour a cup of water into each tin. Remember to keep the amount of water constant to make it a fair test.</li>
              <li>Now let the seeds begin to grow, perhaps on the windowsill in the classroom to make sure that they have a light source.</li>
              <li>Each day, give each tin a tablespoon of water.</li>
              <li>Observe the radish seeds growing for a week, and compare them.</li>
              <li>Measure the height of the radish plants growing in each type of soil. Calculate the average seedling height for each soil type.</li>
              <li>Record your results in a table.</li>
            </ol><div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>To calculate the average height, learners must measure the height of each seedling for a soil type, add all the heights together and then divide by the number of seedlings that have grown for that soil type. They must do this for each soil type.</p>

            <p>
              First draw a line graph to show the change in average height of the seedlings grown in loam soil over time. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
            
            <div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>A line graph is used as we are showing the change over time of one thing. The input, independent variable is the day and this goes on the x-axis. The output, dependent variable is the average height grown and this goes on the y-axis.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Next, draw a bar graph to compare the average height of the seedlings on the last day of your investigation for each soil type used. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
            
            <div class="teachers-guide">
              <p>As with the previous bar graph, a bar graph must be drawn as there are 3 different things being tested which are not related to each other (the different soil types). Soil type goes on the x-axis and Height grown goes on the y-axis, in centimetres or millimetres.</p>

                  <p>The difference has to do with the type of soil that each plant is growing in. The plant on the left is growing in rich loam soil. It can therefore get nutrients from the soil and also water as loam soil has a high water holding capacity. The plant on the right is growing in poor sandy soil which does not have many nutrients. Sandy soil also cannot hold water well as it has coarse particles so the water just runs through. The plant therefore is not getting enough water and is wilting.</p>
