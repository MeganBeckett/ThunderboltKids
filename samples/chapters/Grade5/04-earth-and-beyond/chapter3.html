        <p>Chapter 3 deals with one kind of rock - sedimentary rock. This does leave one wondering what other types of rock there are. The main other type of rock is igneous rock. That is rock that has been hot and molten, and pushed up from deep in the mantle. Mostly it hardens under the ground and we see it only millions of years later when erosion has removed the ground over it. Sometimes it breaks through the crust as molten lava, and we have a volcano. The top of the Drakensberg is the remains of a huge outpouring of lava long ago. Nature is always breaking down rock and eroding it, so mountains are always changing. They change so slowly that we cannot notice it in a person's lifetime, but the changes are happening all the time.</p>
      </div>
      <p>We saw in Chapter 2 that the surface of the Earth is made up of rocks and soil. There are different soil types, but did you know that there are also different types of rock? We classify rocks depending on how they were formed.</p>
      
      <p>We are going to look at sedimentary rock in this chapter and find out how it is formed and used.</p>

        <p>First, rocks break up into smaller pieces, until the pieces are grains of sand. Next, wind and moving water carry the sand and mud away. Then the wind or the water may drop the sand and mud in one place. Finally, the sand grains might get stuck together again over time and make new rock. This new rock is called sedimentary rock.</p>

          <section class="maincontent span10"><p>When the sand grains collect on top of each other, they form a sediment. Over time, new layers of mud and sand are deposited on the previous layers. Over a very long time, these sediments become compacted and hardened and become a sedimentary rock. This happens because the grains of sand become glued together, and other heavy sediments press down on the grains of sand. Sediments lie on top of each other. We can actually see these layers in sedimentary rock and they are sometimes different colours. Find the sediments in the pictures below.</p>

              <p>For this activity, divide the class up into 5 groups - one for each day of the school week (Monday to Friday). Each group must collect sand or soil from a different place so that the different layers are evident by the end of the week. At the beginning of each lesson for the week, you can ask the group for that day to pour their sediment in and then carry on with the rest of the lesson. By the end of the week you can look at the layers of sediment that each group added. Explain to the learners that you are speeding up the process.</p>

The next year more sand came down the river and covered it deeper." If Sophie is standing on the 2013 sediment, then the bird fell into the 2010 sediment. We use the example of yearly floods that bring down sand in a river, because the numbers of years is small. Remind the learners that erosion and deposition has been going on not just these few years, but for millions of years. From the time the first rocks formed from volcanoes on the Earth, weathering, erosion and deposition began to happen. That is why we can find sedimentary rocks that are thousands of millions of years old.</p>

              <strong>Sandstone</strong> is made from grains of sand that are cemented together.

              <strong>Shale</strong> is made from grains of clay that are cemented together. Shale is quite soft and you can use it to write with, like a piece of chalk.

            <li>
              <strong>Limestone</strong> is made of layers of shells of sea-animals that died and sank to the bottom of the sea. Other kinds of limestone are made from sea-water evaporating.
