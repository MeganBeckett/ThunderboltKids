</aside><section class="maincontent span10"><p>Batteries come in all shapes and sizes. Batteries are needed for many different purposes. Most torches, radios, calculators, cell phones, some toys and even cars, pacemakers and hearing aids need batteries to work.</p>
<figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0024.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">Typical batteries</figcaption></figure><p>Batteries are useful because they store chemical energy. When the battery is connected in an electrical appliance and the appliance is switched on, the stored energy in the battery is transferred to the appliance in the form of electrical energy to make it work.</p>

<figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0025.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">The chemical energy from the battery is transferred to electrical energy in the wires, then electrical energy is transferred into heat and light energy in the bulb.</figcaption></figure><p>An electric circuit is a system that consists of different parts. We call these parts the components of the circuit. For example, batteries, light bulbs and connecting wires are components that can make up a circuit. When these components are connected the right way, electricity will be transferred from one component to another. In this example, the electricity would be transferred from the batteries through the connecting wire to the bulb and back through the wire to the batteries to complete the circuit.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>If you have access to the internet, there is a wonderful site that allows you to build circuits and do experiments. Go to <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-dc"></a> and see if you can build some circuits. Experiment to see how to make the globes burn brighter and dimmer.</p>

<p>Batteries are actually made up of smaller parts, known as cells, that store chemical energy. Two or more cells connected end to end are called a battery. We will mostly refer to them as batteries, but keep in mind that `cell' is the scientific term for what most people call a battery in everyday life. One cell stores a small amount of energy. If we need to store a lot of energy we use a battery.</p>

<figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0027.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">A car battery contains 6 cells.</figcaption></figure><p>A car needs a lot of energy to start its engine. One cell does not have enough stored energy. Therefore, a car battery has six cells that are connected end to end inside the battery case. In this case, there is six times more energy stored in the battery than in a single cell. This gives the car enough energy to start the engine.</p>

<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Never use an appliance that has a broken cord or has some of the metal wire showing through the cord casing.</li>
<li>Do not play outside when there is thunder and lightning. If this powerful natural electricity strikes close to you, it will try to get to the ground through you!</li>
<li>Never play near to or on electric fences or power lines. These have live electricity running through them so you can get a shock without even touching them!</li>
<li>Never use electrical appliances outdoors in wet weather or if you are wet. Water conducts electricity well, so you WILL get a shock if you are touching an appliance and water drips into the socket, cord or motor. Wear closed shoes with rubber soles when using electrical appliances. Never use electrical appliances barefoot.</li>
<li>Never use electrical appliances in the bathroom. Remember, electricity can flow through water.</li>
<li>Electricity can flow from one person to the next. NEVER try to pull someone who is being shocked away from the appliance. you will get shocked too! Use a non plastic/non metal object to separate them from the electrical source.</li>
<li>Never put lots of appliances into one socket. Too much electricity flowing to one plug is dangerous. One multi-plug adapter is safe, but do not put adapters into each other. Rather use 2 different plug points.</li>
<li>Never stick a metal knife into a toaster while it is on. First turn the toaster off and unplug it and use a wooden or plastic knife. Beware, electricity can flow through metals. </li>
