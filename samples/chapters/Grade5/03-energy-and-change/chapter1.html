Plants use light energy from the Sun, as well as carbon dioxide and water to grow. Plants take the energy and store it in their leaves, roots and all parts of the plant. Wood also contains this energy stored by plants. Burning wood allows us to change this stored energy into light and heat which is useful to us.</p>

The plants took up energy from the Sun and stored it in their bodies. Millions of years ago, the Earth was mostly covered by water. The plants that died sank to the bottom of the water. Over millions of years, the layers of plants were covered by layers of sand and compressed by the weight of the sand. The plant material was buried deeper and deeper under the ground where it is much hotter than on the surface of the Earth. Over millions of years, the plant remains changed into fossil fuels.</p>

<p>These fuels get their name, "fossil fuels", because they are made from plants and animals that lived a very long time ago.</p>

<p>Natural gas and oil are also examples of fossil fuels. Scientists have realised that tiny sea organisms also died, sank to the the bottom of the ocean, and were buried under the sand. Over millions of years, many layers of dead sea animals got buried like this. Over millions of years, the dead sea animals changed into oil and natural gas.</p>

<aside class="sidebar span2"></aside><section class="maincontent span10"><p>Humans and animals need energy to live. We get our energy from the food that we eat. Do you remember learning about food chains in the beginning of the year in Life and Living?</p>

<div class="activity" type="Questions">
<p>Choose one of the foods that you will eat for lunch today and draw a food chain including this food and ending with you. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Any food chain starting with the Sun and ending with a person (the learner). Perhaps it is a piece of fruit, then it will just be a 3 link food chain. If it is a meat product, then it would be a four link food chain.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Remind learners about food chains and how the direction of the arrows shows the transfer of energy from the Sun and then from one organism to the next.</p>

<p>Food contains stored energy that our bodies can change into useful energy that we need when we run, jump, breathe, learn and do everything else that we do.</p>

<figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0007.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">So we can say that food is the fuel for our bodies! I must need a lot of fuel for my body as I love being active!</figcaption></figure><p>The energy value of food is often shown on the packaging of foods that we buy. The energy of food is measured either in calories (Cal) or in joules (J). A snack such as a packet of chips gives you thousands of joules of energy. Therefore, we rather talk about kilojoules (kJ) of energy when talking about the energy in food.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Spend a moment going over the link between units of measurements and the use of "kilo" as this is often a huge problem with learners in the higher grades. For example, write some of these on the board, \(\text{1000}\) grams (g) = 1 kilogram (kg), \(\text{1000}\) metres (m) = 1 kilometre (km), and then write \(\text{1000}\) joules (j) = &#8230; and ask learners for the answer.</p>
</div>
<p>Have a look at the photo of the side of a mealie meal packet below. The side of the packet contains a lot of information about what the mealie meal contains. The very top line tells us that \(\text{100}\) g of mealie meal will supply your body with \(\text{1368}\) kJ of energy.</p>
<figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0008.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">The nutritional information on a mealie meal packet</figcaption></figure><p>The energy value of a food tells us how much energy that food is worth to our bodies as fuel. An average adult man needs about \(\text{2500}\) kcal or \(\text{10\ 000}\) kJ per day. Children and adults that are not very active need less energy. People that are very active need more energy. These numbers are just to give us an idea of the amount of energy your body needs as fuel everyday.</p>

<p>It is important to eat a balanced diet. In the next activity we are going to look at how much energy different food gives us. In Gr. 6 we will learn a lot more about nutrition and what you should eat to be healthy!</p>

Make sure the learners understand that you need to be able to read the information in the table on the packet. Have a couple of examples with you to show the learners what they are looking for.

This investigations makes use of simple equipment such as tin cans and corks. But, if you have access to a science laboratory, then you can use a metal retort stand, test tube and bunsen burner instead.

<p>The idea of this investigation is to examine the amount of energy given off by a peanut. <strong>NB:</strong> Learners might struggle with linking a burning object, with energy given off, which then heats water, which then gives a reading on a thermometer. Take time to explain how a burning peanut can result in a different reading on a thermometer, and that we are actually looking at the energy given off and not the reading on the thermometer. The thermometer reading is an indicator that more energy is released.The experiment can be taken further to compare different fuels. You can also use a piece of wood, piece of candle wax, piece of biscuit (approximately the same weight of each fuel). It is important to burn the same weight of each fuel so that you can directly compare the amount of energy given off per gram of weight.</p>

</aside><section class="maincontent span10"><p>We have learnt that burning fuels provides us with energy that we can use. What does a fuel need to be able to burn?</p>

<p>It requires some energy to start burning fuel. Fuel needs oxygen to burn. Fuel usually gets oxygen from the air around it. There are other gases present in air as well, but they do not burn.</p>

<p>The following pie chart illustrates how much of each type of gas is found in the air around us.</p>

<p>How much of the air around us consists of oxygen? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Oxygen makes up \(\text{21}\)% of the air around us.</p>
</div></div>

<p>When something burns we say it is combusting. Another word for burning is combustion.</p>

<p>What happens to a flame when we take one of these things away, such as oxygen? When we take something away, we say we deprive it. Let's find out what happens when a flame is deprived of oxygen!</p>

<p>In this experiment we learnt that if you take away the fuel or the oxygen, the flame will stop burning.</p>

<p>For combustion to be possible, three things are required; a heat source, fuel, and oxygen. Without one of the three, combustion will not happen. You can remember this using the Fire Triangle (in the following picture). All three  sides of the triangle are required for combustion.</p>

<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Never play with matches and lighters. Make sure that matches and lighters are kept out of reach of young children who do not know how to use them properly.</li>
<li>In case of fire - stay away. If there is a fire in your home, do not hide, rather go outside as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Know the number of the local fire department and phone in case of emergency.</li>
<li>Have an escape plan for your home and practice it with your family. Have a meeting place outside so that you will know everyone is safe in the event of a fire.</li>
</ol><p>Fire alarms are extremely important to warn people in buildings that a fire has started.</p>

<p>A great additional activity is to demonstrate the use of a fire extinguisher and then ask the learners to explain why it puts out the fire. Does the fire extinguisher blow out the fire? Does it remove oxygen from the burning material? Does it remove heat from the fire? Does it prevent oxygen from getting to the fire? Lots of interesting questions can arise here that could lead to a valuable discussion. No mention need/should be made of carbon dioxide unless the idea has already been raised before this.</p>

<p>Sometimes fires break out and it is important for us to know what to do in the event of a fire.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen any fire posters in your school telling you what to do in case of a fire? Did this poster catch your attention and make you aware of the dangers that fire can hold in your school? Maybe your school does not have any fire posters. Let's create our own fire posters to put up in the school.</p>

<p>The following actions should be shown in the plays:</p>

<p>To escape from a building, fall and crawl.</p>

<p>When clothes are on fire, stop, drop and roll, or cover in a blanket or carpet.</p>

<p>If a friend is in a building, learners should show that they NEVER go into the building themselves, but rather call for help.</p>

<p>Assess the learners' plays as a group according to how clearly the learners speak and demonstrate the actions to do with their bodies and by acting out.</p>

<p>The curtain could blow against the hot iron and catch fire and burn the house down. The wind blowing in from the window would also help to spread the fire. She should rather turn the iron off when not using it and close the window so the curtain does not blow against the iron.</p>
