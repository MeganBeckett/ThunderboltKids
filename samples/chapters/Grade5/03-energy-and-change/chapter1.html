            <strong>Wood</strong> is often collected and burnt to give us heat and light. On a cold evening, it is wonderful to sit around a fire to tell stories and warm yourself with friends.

          <p>Wood comes from plants, specifically trees. Plants use light energy from the Sun, as well as carbon dioxide and water to grow. Plants take the energy and store it in their leaves, roots and all parts of the plant. Wood also contains this energy stored by plants. Burning wood allows us to change this stored energy into light and heat which is useful to us.</p>

            <strong>Coal</strong> is a type of fossil fuel that is also burnt to provide us with heat that we can use. The heat from coal can be used to cook our food and warm our houses.
          </p>

          <p>Fossil fuels like coal were made from prehistoric plants. The plants took up energy from the Sun and stored it in their bodies. Millions of years ago, the Earth was mostly covered by water. The plants that died sank to the bottom of the water. Over millions of years, the layers of plants were covered by layers of sand and compressed by the weight of the sand. The plant material was buried deeper and deeper under the ground where it is much hotter than on the surface of the Earth. Over millions of years, the plant remains changed into fossil fuels.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <p/>
          
          <p>These fuels get their name, "fossil fuels", because they are made from plants and animals that lived a very long time ago.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Natural gas and oil are also examples of fossil fuels. Scientists have realised that tiny sea organisms also died, sank to the the bottom of the ocean, and were buried under the sand. Over millions of years, many layers of dead sea animals got buried like this. Over millions of years, the dead sea animals changed into oil and natural gas.</p>

            <strong>Wax</strong> in a candle is burnt to provide light. By burning the candle, the stored energy in the wax is released as light and heat energy.

            <strong>Paraffin</strong> is also a fuel that contains stored energy. Paraffin is burnt in paraffin lamps and paraffin stoves to provide us with useful energy in the form of light and heat.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Gas</strong> is another fuel that can be burnt to release stored energy in the form of heat and light. We can use gas heaters to keep warm, and gas stoves to cook food and boil water. Natural gas is odourless and colourless, and it is also known as 'clean gas' because, unlike other fossil fuels, it doesn't produce harmful byproducts when it burns.

          <section class="maincontent span10"><p>Humans and animals need energy to live. We get our energy from the food that we eat. Do you remember learning about food chains in the beginning of the year in Life and Living?</p>

          <p>Food contains stored energy that our bodies can change into useful energy that we need when we run, jump, breathe, learn and do everything else that we do.</p>
          
          <p/>

I must need a lot of fuel for my body as I love being active!</figcaption></figure><p/>
          
          <p>The energy value of food is often shown on the packaging of foods that we buy. The energy of food is measured either in calories (Cal) or in joules (J). A snack such as a packet of chips gives you thousands of joules of energy. Therefore, we rather talk about kilojoules (kJ) of energy when talking about the energy in food.</p>
          
          <p/>
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Spend a moment going over the link between units of measurements and the use of "kilo" as this is often a huge problem with learners in the higher grades. For example, write some of these on the board, \(\text{1000}\) grams (g) = 1 kilogram (kg), \(\text{1000}\) metres (m) = 1 kilometre (km), and then write \(\text{1000}\) joules (j) = &#8230; and ask learners for the answer.</p>
          </div>
          <p/>
          
          <p>Have a look at the photo of the side of a mealie meal packet below. The side of the packet contains a lot of information about what the mealie meal contains. The very top line tells us that \(\text{100}\) g of mealie meal will supply your body with \(\text{1368}\) kJ of energy.</p>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0008.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0008.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">The nutritional information on a mealie meal packet</figcaption></figure><p/>
          
          <p>The energy value of a food tells us how much energy that food is worth to our bodies as fuel. An average adult man needs about \(\text{2500}\) kcal or \(\text{10\ 000}\) kJ per day. Children and adults that are not very active need less energy. People that are very active need more energy. These numbers are just to give us an idea of the amount of energy your body needs as fuel everyday.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>It is important to eat a balanced diet. In the next activity we are going to look at how much energy different food gives us. In Gr. 6 we will learn a lot more about nutrition and what you should eat to be healthy!</p>

              <p>About two weeks before you get to this activity, ask the learners to start bringing in packages from food that they eat, e.g. cereal boxes, butter wrappers, egg boxes, sweet wrappers, biscuit boxes, chip packets, rice packets, bread packets etc. The bigger the variety of packages the better. Make sure the learners understand that you need to be able to read the information in the table on the packet. Have a couple of examples with you to show the learners what they are looking for. NB: Not all foods will give kJ per \(\text{100}\) g. Ask learners to attempt to do some of the conversions themselves.</p>

                The idea of this investigation is to examine the amount of energy given off by a peanut. <strong>NB:</strong> Learners might struggle with linking a burning object, with energy given off, which then heats water, which then gives a reading on a thermometer. Take time to explain how a burning peanut can result in a different reading on a thermometer, and that we are actually looking at the energy given off and not the reading on the thermometer. The thermometer reading is an indicator that more energy is released.The experiment can be taken further to compare different fuels. You can also use a piece of wood, piece of candle wax, piece of biscuit (approximately the same weight of each fuel). It is important to burn the same weight of each fuel so that you can directly compare the amount of energy given off per gram of weight.

              <li>Use the hammer and nail to make holes all around the bottom of the large can. These are air holes.</li>
              <li>Use the small can and punch two holes near the top of the can exactly opposite each other.</li>
              <li>Slide the metal spike through the two holes in the small can.</li>
              <li>Pour 150 ml of water into the small can.</li>
              <li>Use the thermometer to measure the temperature of the water and record it in the results table.</li>
              <li>Put the cork and peanut on a surface that cannot burn. Use the lighter to light the peanut. The peanut can be difficult to light so keep trying. It will eventually start burning.</li>
              <li>As soon as the peanut is burning, carefully place the large can over the peanut. Balance the small can inside the big can as shown in the diagram. The small can must be a short distance above the peanut.</li>

        <p>We have learnt that burning fuels provides us with energy that we can use. What does a fuel need to be able to burn?</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>It requires some energy to start burning fuel. Fuel needs oxygen to burn. Fuel usually gets oxygen from the air around it. There are other gases present in air as well, but they do not burn.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>The following pie chart illustrates how much of each type of gas is found in the air around us.</p>

        <p>In this experiment we learnt that if you take away the fuel or the oxygen, the flame will stop burning.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>For combustion to be possible, three things are required; a heat source, fuel, and oxygen. Without one of the three, combustion will not happen. You can remember this using the Fire Triangle (in the following picture). All three  sides of the triangle are required for combustion.</p>

        <p>We have spoken a lot about fire and burning in this chapter so far. Fire is a major source of heat energy for many people whether it for keeping warm, cooking food or for some other purpose. Although fire is very useful it is also very dangerous! Great care is needed when using fire. Fire is a threat in our communities.</p>

Does it remove oxygen from the burning material? Does it remove heat from the fire? Does it prevent oxygen from getting to the fire? Lots of interesting questions can arise here that could lead to a valuable discussion. No mention need/should be made of carbon dioxide unless the idea has already been raised before this.</p>
