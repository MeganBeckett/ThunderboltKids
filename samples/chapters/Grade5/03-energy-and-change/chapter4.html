        <p>There is no specified Technology Design Process in this chapter, but the focus is on Technology and systems. In Gr. 6 in Earth and Beyond, learners will follow a Design Process and design and make a car to move on the Moon or Mars. They will revise some of the concepts that they learnt here about wheels and axles.</p>

          <h3 class="title">How did wheels and axles develop?</h3>
          <section class="maincontent span10"><p>In the past, before the wheel was invented, it was very difficult to move things around. People would try to drag heaving objects along the ground using ropes, or else they had to carry things, but this was very inefficient! As a result, people started to experiment with ways of making it easier to transport goods and heavy objects.</p>
          
          <p>The pyramids in Egypt were built long before modern transport (including trucks) was invented.</p>

              The pyramids are very high structures made of stone. <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaybergesen/3335698859/"></a>
            </figcaption></figure><p>The Egyptians were very clever in finding ways to move very heavy objects. They used logs that were laid down like in the picture. The heavy objects were placed on them, rolling them creating movement like in the picture.</p>

            <p>You can demonstrate this by using pencils and placing a bunch of pencils next to each other. Then put a heavy object on top of the pencils and push it along. As the object moves the pencils underneath it move too.</p>
          </div>
          <p>The Egyptians used this method to move the massive blocks of stone to build their pyramids. But, there were still many problems with using logs cut from trees.</p>

            <p>The first inflatable tyre was made of leather. Today they are made from rubber.</p>

            <p>This can be demonstrated by using different shapes and sizes of pencils and pens.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Later on, people started to cut the logs into short pieces so that they were the same size. Each piece was like a wooden disc. The wooden disc could not stand up by itself so people attached a wooden pole between two of the wooden discs. The wooden pole was the first axle, and we still use axles to this day. That is how the first wheel and axle was developed!</p>
          
          <p>People could then balance goods on the axle and use this simple machine to pull or push objects along. However, this wooden disc wheel was still very heavy! To make it lighter, the wheel was changed to a round frame with spokes, like a wagon wheel. This made it much lighter and easier to move. Since then, the wheel has advanced a lot. Think of the shiny metal and rubber wheels you see on cars today!</p>

          <p>We are now going to experiment with different ways of making wheels and axles and finding out the best materials to use.</p>
          
          <p>There are two ways to let wheels turn on an axle. One way is to have the axle fixed to the body, and the wheels are free to turn on the axle. The other way is to have the wheels fixed to the axle and the axle turns in a bigger tube called the bearing. The bearing is the hollow tube that the axle goes through. The bearing must be bigger than the axle so that the axle can turn easily.</p>
          
          <p>You can use plastic straws or the barrel of an old ball-point pen to make a bearing for an axle. The picture shows you two ways to fix the bearings onto the body.</p>

Ask learners to collect the materials for wheels and axles from home beforehand - tell them to also use their imaginations when looking for different materials to use. You will also need to supply some of the materials below.</p>
