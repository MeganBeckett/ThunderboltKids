          <strong>Introducing the unit</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This unit provides an opportunity for learners to think of materials in terms of the distinctions between <strong>raw</strong> and <strong>processed</strong> materials. It is also an opportunity to link to Indigenous Knowledge when dealing with traditional methods of processing materials, and to draw learners attention to the fact that many of these traditional methods of processing are still used today. They are mostly supportive of sustainable living practices, and are becoming very trendy as a result. The introduction to this unit links it to the units that have preceded it.

          We call materials that have not yet been processed <em>raw materials</em>. Raw materials are made into other things. When raw materials are in the form in which they are found in nature, we can call them natural materials. A <em>natural material</em> is any material that comes from plants, animals, or the ground.
        </p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>We have learnt that there are many different ways in which materials can be processed to give them new properties. After processing they may look, smell, feel or taste different. They will probably also be used for a totally different purpose from before.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>Processed materials are materials which have been refined or built by humans from raw materials. Some examples include paper, steel and glass.</p>

            <strong>Teacher's note:</strong> In this activity the learners must study a list of materials and then decide which represent raw materials and which represent processed materials. It is recommended that this should be a small group activity, since discussion and joint decision making is required.

        <p>Materials that have been processed are very useful to us because they have special properties. We already know that processed materials can be strong and durable. But what other properties do they have? Let's look at some example.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>What do you put on when it is raining outside? Some processed materials are useful to use because they are waterproof. A rain jacket is made of a material which is waterproof, and so is an umbrella. Maybe you might wear gum boots or wellingtons? These shoes are very waterproof and made from specially processed plastic and rubber.</p>

        <p>We have just seen that processed materials can be used because they have special properties (such as paint having the ability to change an object's colour). In the last chapter we looked at concrete. We learned how to make concrete by combining different materials. But concrete can also be used decoratively as it has many different textures. Look at the pictures below which give some idea of the different textures of concrete and how it is used to make surfaces look interesting!</p>

          <p>This section is quite reading-intensive. There are two rather long stories about the Khoikhoi youngster, Heitsi, that describe various methods of traditional processing. The stories have been written in such a way that they are factually correct, and so they may link well with other learning areas such as Life Orientation or Social Studies.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>One idea would be to use these stories as comprehension pieces. Depending on the reading level of your learners you may choose to read it to them, or let the learners each read a paragraph in turn. (It is a requirement of CAPS that 'learners should read, write, draw and do practical tasks regularly'.) Another idea may be to allow learners to act out the two stories about Heitsi and his family.</p>

            An important cultural message to bring across is the <strong>resourcefulness</strong> of our ancestors, and how they used <strong>what was available</strong> to make their lives more comfortable.

        <p>People have been processing materials from the earliest times. In the old days only natural materials were available and people found many clever ways to make these materials more useful.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>The first people who lived in our land had ways to harden wood and bone for making tools and hunting weapons. They also had ways of reinforcing the mud used for making traditional huts. They knew which materials made the best clothes and blankets, and which grass made the softest beds. They also knew exactly which reeds would make the best mats to cover their walls, and how to build houses best suited for their climate and lifestyle.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>Some of these traditional ways of processing materials are still used today. In this section we will learn more about them.</p>

            <p>Fire-hardening is the process of removing moisture from wood (or bone) by slowly and lightly roasting it over a fire. This process makes a point (like that of a spear) or an edge (like that of a knife) stronger and more durable.</p>

          <p>Before South Africa was a country, several interesting groups of people lived in our land. The Khoikhoi people were one of the first nations to live in Southern Africa and many modern day South-Africans are descendants of the Khoikhoi. The Khoikhoi were pastoral people who kept goats, but also hunted animals for their meat and skins.</p>

            <li>Read the story carefully, and look out for clues about the ways in which Heitsi's people used and processed materials.</li>

            <strong>Heitsi prepares for the hunt</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Heitsi is getting his hunting kit ready for the hunt. He is not a man yet, but already a good hunter. When he was born, 11 summers ago, his mother named him after Heitsi-eibib, who was a mythical hunter, sorcerer and warrior in the stories of his people. His father and uncles have taught him how to use the traditional hunting weapons of the Khoikhoi: the bow and arrow and the "kierie" (throwing stick).</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Heitsi is very excited about the hunt. Today he is hoping to kill a springbok, because he wants to cut a head dress for himself from the skin of the springbok. He can already imagine how envious his friends will be when he wears it proudly around his head.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>
            He will give the rest of the springbok skin to his mother to turn into a blanket (<em>karos</em>) or a piece of clothing for his new baby sister. His mother will scrape the skin with a sharp stone or metal blade to remove the hair and rub it with animal fat for a long time to make it soft.
          </p>
          
          <p/>
          <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0053.png"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0053.png" width="300"/></noscript></figure><p>Heitsi slings the quiver in which he keeps his arrows over his shoulder. The quiver is made from tree bark. It is a good quiver, but he really wants one made of animal skin like the one his father carries. The arrows inside the quiver have wooden shafts and sharp tips made of metal. His younger cousins have arrows with tips made of hardwood. In the old days all the arrow tips were made of wood or bone, but Heitsi's people have been making contact with other peoples who have introduced them to metal.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>He also keeps some tinder in his quiver. Tinder is the name for the soft, dry plant materials his people use when starting a fire. Another item he keeps in the quiver is a hollow reed that can be used like a straw to suck up water that has collected on the leaves of plants.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>He knows that he has to handle the arrow tips very carefully because they are very sharp. He keeps them sharp by rubbing them on a special stone.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>Another reason why Heitsi handles the arrows very carefully is because their tips have been covered with a layer of poison. His cousins sometimes use the sap from poisonous plants to treat their arrow tips, but he prefers to use snake poison because it is more potent.</p>
          
          <p/>
          
          <p>He picks up his bow, and admires it for a moment. He made it himself from the flexible wood of a wild olive tree. The bow string is made from the gut of a small wild cat that he hunted last summer. His uncle's bow has a string made of twisted palm leaves, and it makes a beautiful sound when Uncle holds the end of the bow in his mouth and taps against the string with a stick. Tonight, when they return from the hunt, the men will dance around the fire while the women sing and clap their hands. There will be stories told about the hunt, and Heitsi will honour the soul of the springbok that he has killed.</p>

            The last weapon he picks up is his <em>kierie</em>. It has a long handle and a knob at the top end. The <em>kierie</em> was a gift from his favourite uncle. Uncle made it himself from strong wood. To make the kierie even stronger, Uncle placed it close to the fire for a long time. The heat from the fire dried out the wood and made it tough and strong.

        <p>Later, we will read about the traditional Khoikhoi house that Heitsi and his family lived in. First, we will learn about a different kind of traditional home, that is still seen today.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>
          Some of the traditional homes in Africa are made of clay or mud. In the activity <em>Making Bricks</em>, we saw that mud (a mixture of soil and water) is not a very strong material. When it is dry, it can crumble and collapse. When it is reinforced, it can make a strong and durable building material  that can be used to build a house. If it is built well, the house will last for many years.

For example the steps could include to first put sticks into the ground to mark out where the walls of the house would be, then to collect or make the mud, and to add grass and stones to reinforce it. Then pack the mud up against the sticks as the you boy is doing in the first picture. Then to leave the mud to dry.</p>

        <p>
          You may remember from the story <em>Heitsi prepares for the hunt</em>, that Heitsi belongs to the Khoikhoi people from the days before South Africa was a country. In those days there were no borders, no provinces, no towns or cities, and no roads. No-one 'owned' land; the land belonged to everyone who lived on it. Imagine that!
        </p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>Like all the early people, the Khoikhoi had to make everything they needed, because there were no shops then! They had to use whatever materials were freely available.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>
          The Khoikhoi people were <em>nomads</em>. That means they did not live in one place for long. They moved their homes and their belongings every few months, when the seasons changed. By moving around, they could always live near good grazing. Fresh green grass and trees meant there would be leaf-eating animals around to hunt. I also meant there would be good food around for themselves, and for their goats to eat.
        </p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>Read the story carefully for clues on which materials were used to make a traditional Khoikhoi house.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Heitsi moves house</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>Heitsi's clan is on the move again. A few days ago, the clan packed up all their belongings and started their long trek to the place that will be their home for the summer months. The place where they lived had become dry and dusty and it was becoming more and more difficult to find good things to eat. They took apart their hut, which they will rebuild when they reach their destination.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>
          During the long trek, everyone has to help carry things. Heitsi is carrying his own sleeping mat and <em>karos</em>, and his hunting weapons. He also has to keep an eye on the goats in case they wander too far from the clan.
        </p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>After many days of walking, they arrived at the place that would be their new home. Now they can rebuild their house.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>The framework of the house must be strong so that the house will stand firm. Heitsi's mother and aunties have found some young trees nearby and are cutting long, thin branches that will be perfect for making a frame for the house. Once they have cut the branches, they strip off the leaves.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>The men bend the flexible branches into crescent (half-moon) shapes and tie them together with flexible strips of tree bark. This is how they build a dome-shaped framework for the house.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>Can you see the framework of tree branches? Can you see what the house is made of?</p>
        
        <p/>
        <div class="teachers-guide">
          <p>You could draw attention on the photos that the framework is made of thin, flexible branches, and the hut is made of reed mats.</p>
        </div>
        <p/>
        <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0064.jpg"/><noscript><img src="images/gd-0064.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">Women attaching the reed mats to the framework.</figcaption></figure><p/>
        
        <p>
          Once the framework is built, it is ready to be covered with reed mats. For this reason the house is called a <em>matjieshuis</em> (mat-house). Heitsi's mother and aunties made the mats by threading reeds together with string that she made from the long thin leaves of palm trees.
        </p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>The whole family has to help with the floor of the house. They bring clay from a nearby river and Heitsi's mother makes the floor by stomping down the wet clay with her feet. Once the clay has dried, the floor will be smeared with animal manure. This is not as disgusting as it sounds - the manure seals the clay to prevent it from becoming sandy and dusty.</p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>
          A fire-hole will be dug in the middle of the floor, with sleeping hollows (about 15 cm deep) around it. Soft plant material will be placed in the sleeping hollows, and this will be covered with mats and <em>karosses</em> to make comfortable beds for Heitsi and his family.
        </p>
        
        <p/>
        
        <p>Heitsi loves his portable home. It is the perfect shelter. In hot, dry weather, the openings between the reeds allow air to circulate inside the house to keep it cool. It also lets in light. He knows that when the rains come and the reed mats get wet, the reeds will absorb water and swell out. Then they will seal tight and protect the inside of the house against leaks. During the cold months, the inside of the house will also be lined with animal skins to make it extra warm and comfortable..</p>

          We saw that Hetsie's family used grass to make the reed mats for their <em>matjieshuis.</em> In Africa, many people make objects by using plant products, called plant fibres. The people weave and stitch the plant fibres together to make different objects, such as reed mats, baskets, or even thatch to make a roof for a house. This is also a type of traditional processing.

                    Look at the picture of a <em>matjieshuis</em> below. It is an old one and it was made differently to the one Hetsie's family made as this one does not use reed mats, but rather bushes that have been tied onto the frame. Which method do you think is better and why?

                <div class="problem">Making objects out of plants is a traditional African process. There are different ways of doing it and different parts of the plants which can be used. The three pictures below all show photos of woven products, but they have been made using different plants parts. Write a description of each and say what kind of object you think it might be used for.
