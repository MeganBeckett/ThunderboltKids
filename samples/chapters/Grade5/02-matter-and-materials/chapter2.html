<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This unit addresses additional properties of metals, such as magnetic properties, conductivity and corrosion. One way of introducing this unit would be to have a conversation about magnets; this could include a demonstration of magnets attracting each other. You could ask students to name examples where magnets are used in everyday life (fridge magnets, magnetic cupboard doors, magnetic strips in the doors of fridges and freezers, magnetic toys, etc.). They could be asked to predict whether a metal object (a key for instance) would be attracted to a magnet, and this could be followed by a demonstration. The prediction could be repeated with a non-metal object such as a piece of chalk or plastic.</p>

<p>We have learnt that whenever we wish to make something new, we first have to decide what the purpose of that product will be. Since we are learning about <em>Matter and Materials</em>, let us assume that the product will be a tool or any other kind of object that will be doing a job for us. Once we have decided what the purpose of the object will be, we can choose a material with the right properties for the job.</p>

</aside><section class="maincontent span10"><p>Have you ever played with magnets? Did you notice how magnets attract other magnets, and also certain metal objects?</p>

<p>In the next activity we will investigate magnetism and write our findings in a table.</p>

<p>Magnetism is a very interesting property and playing with magnets and materials is fun! Were all the metals that you tested attracted to the magnet?</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Here, learners could be reminded that <strong>some but not all</strong> the metals were attracted to the magnet. Only iron, cobalt and nickel are magnetic. Learners don't need to know this, but they need to know that it is only a few metals that are magnetic. However, MANY appliances and tools are made of iron, making lots of the metals objects around us magnetic.</p>
</div>
<p>In the next activity we are going to test the magnetic properties of different metals. There is also a problem that Tom needs to help solve. After you have completed the activity you may be able to give him some advice on how to use magnetism to solve the problem!</p>

<p>Not all metals are magnetic. We've seen how metals can be sorted according to their magnetic properties.</p>

<aside class="sidebar span2"></aside><section class="maincontent span10"><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This investigation helps learners to discover that magnetism is a property unique to metals. Some metals are attracted to a magnet, but non-metals are generally not attracted to a magnet. One of the important misconceptions that learners have is that all metals are magnetic. The activity following this investigation will help them to discover that this is not true.</p>

<p>You should try to include at least one non-magnetic metallic object so that the learners discover that not all metals are attracted to a magnet. Aluminium (eg. kitchen foil), zinc or copper all fall in this category. The reason why South African copper coins are attracted to a magnet is because they are made of iron (which is attracted to a magnet), with a thin coating of copper on the outside.</p>

<aside class="sidebar span2"></aside><section class="maincontent span10"><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This activity is also ideal for small group participation. It requires a fair bit of reading, as there are a few lines of dialogue included. These could be read aloud by two learners, one playing the role of Tom and another playing the role of Uncle. The group can solve the problem together and Tom can present the solution to Uncle at the end of the activity.</p>

<p>It would be good to keep an eye out for small objects or pieces of aluminium, copper and iron (or steel) that could be used in the investigation. Zinc could also be used, as it is also not attracted to a magnet. Label the pieces with the type of metal it is made of.</p>

Uncle owns the junkyard. He buys all kinds of scrap metal, which he then sells to a recycling company. The recycling company pays more if the metal is sorted by type. Uncle has a problem. He does not know how to sort the metal. One day, he is talking to Tom about his problem.</p>

<p>Uncle:        "Tom, I need your advice. I know you are clever with inventions, and that you like a challenge."</p>

<p>Tom:        "That is true, Uncle. I love a challenge! What is your problem? Maybe I can help you solve it with science!"</p>

<p>Uncle:        "I have a huge pile of metal scrap that I need to sort. I know there is iron, aluminium and copper in the pile of metal scrap. But I have no idea how to do this! Iron and aluminium are both metals, and look very similar. Can you think of a way to help me sort them?"</p>

<p>What do you think Tom's advice to Uncle will be?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners should be encouraged to think of multiple solutions. One way of sorting the copper from the other metals would be by colour. Copper is reddish-brown, and the other two metals are silvery. Aluminium is light compared to iron. But sometimes it is not that easy to distinguish the two metals on the basis of relative mass (Aluminium is actually less dense than iron, but the concept of density may be too advanced for learners to grasp at this level.) Iron, however, is magnetic, while aluminium is not. This means a magnet would 'pick up' iron pieces but not aluminium pieces.</p>
</div>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>A few metal pieces have been placed in front of you. Find the label on each piece and read the name out loud. Give everyone in your group a chance to say the names of the metals.</li>
<li>Write the name of each metal in the table below.  </li>
<li>Look at each metal carefully. Do they look the same, or are they different? Can you describe the colour of each metal? Write the colour of each metal in the table below.</li>
<li>Hold each metal near the magnet. If the metal is attracted to the magnet, draw a cross (X) in the column "Magnetic". If the metal is not attracted to the magnet, draw a cross (X) in the column "Not magnetic".</li>

<p>Learners' lists could contain the following:</p>

<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Take out all the reddish-brown pieces of metal and place it in one pile. This is the copper.</li>
<li>Test the remaining metal pieces with the magnet. If the metal is attracted to the magnet it contains iron. Put it in a separate pile.</li>
<li>All the pieces that are left should be put in a third pile. This is the aluminium.</li>
</ol><p>An idea for extending this activity would be to ask learners to design a magnetic arm for pulling iron pieces out of a pile of scrap metal. Depending on the ingenuity of the learners the design could be drawn on paper, or even built from whatever materials they can find.</p>

<p>Here, we pick up on an earlier conversation that alerted learners to the fact that when we cook food, we heat the <strong>outside</strong> of the pot, the food cooks on the <strong>inside</strong>. That means the heat that cooks the food travels through the metal. In the investigation that follows learners will investigate whether heat travels through plastic and wood in the same way that it travels through metal.</p>
</div>
<p>We will now investigate another special property of metals. But first, a question: How do we cook food on the stove?  We put the food inside a metal pot, and then we heat the outside of the pot. This makes the food cook on the inside! How does the heat get inside the pot? The next activity will help us answer this question.</p>

<p>The next section investigates corrosion (rust), and could be introduced by a conversation about metal objects that are shiny when new and become dull when they are left outside. Several pictures have been included below to stimulate the discussion. The important message to get across is that rust is a form of corrosion. Only iron rusts, but other metals can also corrode.</p>
</div>
<p>Have you ever noticed how some metal objects are shiny when they are new, but over time the shine disappears and they become dull and blotchy? The car in the picture was once shiny and new, but look at it now! It is covered in rust from standing out in the rain for so long.</p>

<figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0013.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">An old car covered in rust. <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kb35/2289942750/"></a></figcaption></figure><p>Rust has a reddish-brown colour and a rough texture. Rust is very common; it is the product that forms when iron corrodes. During corrosion, iron reacts with oxygen in the air or in water to form iron oxide (the chemical name for rust). Rust is a type of corrosion, but it is not the only type.</p>

<p>Other types of corrosion include:</p>

<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Tarnish (found on silver teapots, trays, trophies and jewellery)</li>
<li>Patina (the green coating that we sometimes see on copper objects)</li>
<li>Black spots that appear on brass.</li>
<li>Aluminium oxide (grey-white coating that forms on aluminium)</li>

Other metals also change when they are not protected. Have you noticed what coins look like when they are new? New coins are bright and shiny. Old coins are dull and they look dirty. That is because they have a dark layer of tarnish on them. In the next activity we will see how the layer of tarnish can be removed to make coins bright and shiny again.</p>

<p>Next, we are going to learn more interesting things about metals and what they are used for.</p></section><div class="activity" type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">INVESTIGATION: Learning about corrosion (rust)</h1><aside class="sidebar span2"></aside><section class="maincontent span10"><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This investigation is ideal for small group work, and should be done over a number of days. On the first day learners will place iron nails in different media, and then observe how they rust over a period of 5 to 10 days (depending how much time is available). The containers should be covered with plastic wrap if possible, to prevent evaporation of the water. It is important that the nails in container C should be kept as dry as possible, so learners should be told to handle them only with dry hands. It may help to instruct them to always check the nails in container C first, before checking the other containers. If any of the contents in the containers should spill, they can simply be refilled with the same solution (water or salt water)</p>

<li>Place the containers next to each other in a safe spot where they can be left undisturbed for a few days.</li>
<li>Check the nails in the containers every day. Every day (preferably at the same time each day) count the number of nails that have rust on them. Make sure to return the same nails to the same container after you have examined them. Continue to do this over a period of 10 days.</li>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>When learners draw the graphs they could be encouraged to think about what the dependent and independent variables would be. Time (measured in days in this case) would be the independent variable and should therefore go on the horizontal (x) axis.  Explain to learners that the independent variable is the thing that you are controlling (ie. you are controlling the time). Number of nails with rust on them should go on the vertical (y) axis since it is the dependent variable. This is because the amount of rust that develops is dependent on the time that the nails are left on the containers for. If all three graphs are drawn on the same set of axes, the graphs can be compared. The graph with the steepest slope (gradient) would represent the conditions that are most conducive to rust. It might be difficult to draw all three graphs on the same axis. In that case, draw three separate graphs for each of the containers, but use the same scale. That way, you will still be able 
to compare the slope.</p>

<p>This section focuses on more ways in which metals are used. Draw learners' attention to metallic objects in and around the classroom. They could each bring one picture of a metallic object to class and these could then be sorted into categories, for instance 'transport', 'the kitchen', 'industry', etc. Learners could generate the categories themselves, and then be encouraged to think about the reasons why metal is used for each particular purpose. The second paragraph discusses why metal is used for electrical cables and is a good example of how such a discussion may be encouraged. The activity that follows has the same purpose.</p>
</div>
<p>Metals have thousands of uses. We use metals every day, sometimes even without knowing!</p>

<p>Metals are ductile and good conductors of electricity.  This is why metal is used to make the wire inside electrical cables. Without electrical cables we would not have electricity in our homes or schools; we would not have lights or television, or telephones. (Next term we will look more at electricity!)</p>

<p>Metals are extremely strong and can be turned into thin sheets. These sheets can be used to make the bodies of the cars, trucks, trains and aeroplanes that are used to transport people and goods from one place to another.</p>

<div class="activity" type="Revision"><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>List as many properties of metals as you can think of. </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Metals are solid, strong, malleable, ductile, and lustrous. In addition: Some metals are magnetic; metals conduct heat and electricity; and some metals corrode (for instance iron rusts).</p>

            </div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Are non-metals magnetic? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>No</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Tom used magnetism to help his uncle. Which metal in the junkyard was attracted to the magnet? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Tom used a magnet to pick up all the <strong>iron</strong> scrap in the junkyard.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Are all metals magnetic? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>No</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why are most pots and pans made of metal? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Metal is a good conductor of heat and that makes it a good material for cooking utensils.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why do some pots and pans have handles made of plastic or wood? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Metal conducts heat but plastic and wood do not. That means the handles will stay cool even when the pot is too hot to touch.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why does iron that is shiny when it is new become dull and blotchy when it stands outside for a long time? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>The iron rusts.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What does rust look like? (Describe what it looks and feels like.)
    </div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Rust is reddish-brown and feels rough and flaky.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What is another name for rust? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Corrosion.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Do all metals rust? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>No, only iron rusts.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Your dad is putting up a new iron fence in front of your hose. What would you tell him to do to make the fence last long? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>He can paint it as this will help prevent the iron from rusting.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Look at the picture below of a hammer. What is the head of each hammer made from and why do you think this material was used?
            <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0019.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">Different sized hammers. <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mauroescritor/6342745960/"></a></figcaption></figure><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>The head of the hammer is made from metal. Metal is strong and hard. The hammer is used to hit other hard objects (such as nails) so it needs to be made from a hard material.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>If you had to advise your parents or a family friend who wants to buy a set of chairs and tables for their garden to replace the plastic ones which have broken, what would you advise them are the best types of furniture for outside in the garden? Explain your answer. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>The best furniture should be made of some metal (not iron) as they will be more durable and not break like the plastic. Metal furniture will last longer than, for example, wooden furniture, if left outside and in the rain.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Some jewellery is made from metal. What types of metal is jewellery made from and why do you think some of these metals are so expensive. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Jewellery is made from metals such as gold, silver, platinum, gold and also copper. These metals are expensive because they are not very common to find in the Earth and they go through expensive procedures to get them looking the way they do in the finished product. They are also expensive due to the demand - a higher demand raises the price of something.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why do you think your kitchen utensils (such as knives, forks and spoons) are normally made from metal and not plastic and wood? Why then do fast food restaurants give you plastic utensils with your take aways? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Kitchen utensils that need to last a long time are made from metal. This is because the metal is strong and will not dent or break when thrown into the drawer or washed in the sink. At fast food restaurants, you are normally given plastic utensils as these can be thrown away. They are not meant to last long. If they had to supply you with metal utensils with all takeaways it would be much more expensive.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Below is a picture of a fire engine truck. Can you imagine a fire engine made from plastic or wood?! What properties of metal make it suitable for the fire engine?
        <figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0020.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">A fire engine made of metal.</figcaption></figure><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Metal can be hammered into sheets which are strong and durable and these are used to make the shell of the truck. The metal is hard and strong so when people climb on the truck, the metal does not break or crack like plastic would. Metal also only melts at very high temperatures. Since a fire engine often gets close to fire and in very hot areas, if it was made from plastic, the plastic would melt. The metal does not melt. If it was made from wood, the wood could also catch fire and burn. The metal will last long if it gets wet from the hoses or standing outside on the sun and rain. Plastic or wood would not last as long and begin to perish or rot.</p>
