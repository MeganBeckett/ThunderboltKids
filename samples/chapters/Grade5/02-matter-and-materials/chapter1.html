<li>How do we decide what material to use when we want to make or build something?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The first important message of this unit is that <strong>purpose</strong> comes before <strong>choice of material</strong>. Once we know the purpose of whatever product it is we want to produce, we can decide what properties we need the building material to have, and then choose a material that possesses those properties.</p>

<p>In the first unit of Matter and Materials, we distinguish between materials that are metallic and those that are not. Although this is not a formal definition, we group everything that is not metallic into the category of non-metals. We make the distinction between metals and non-metals on the basis of properties, and so it is important to establish a firm understanding of the term <strong>properties</strong> early on.</p>

<p>You could start with a conversation about building something new (like the dog house example below), then steer the conversation towards properties by asking questions around the ways in which the object will be <strong>used</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>In this chapter we will learn about metals and non-metals. Do you remember learning about materials in Grade 4. Metals and non-metals are two different classes of materials. Each class has its own unique properties. <em>Properties</em> are the things that are special or unique about an object or a material. We can use the properties of a material to describe what it is like. For example, we could say that a property of a gas is that it can be compressed.</p>

<p>When we want to make a new product (a building or a tool or any kind of object) we first have to decide what the purpose of that product will be. Perhaps we want to make a tool for digging in the garden, or a kennel (dog house) for our new puppy. The purpose of the product will help us decide which would be the best material with which to make the object.</p>

<p>What would be the best material for a digging tool? Surely we would need a tool that is strong and durable; with a sharp edge that will allow us to cut through the soil when we dig into it.</p>

<div class="activity" type="Questions"><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">

  </div></div></div></div>
</div>

<p>The next activity is about the things we think about when we choose materials for a specific purpose. In this case the purpose is building a house.</p>
<p>Now that we have looked at the different types of materials that you could use to build a house and seen that there are different cases when you would use one material or another, let's look at the actual properties of metals and non-metals.</p>
</section><div class="activity" type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Choosing a material to build a house</h1><aside class="sidebar span2"></aside><section class="maincontent span10"><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The purpose of the activity is for learners to discover that there are many options to choose from when choosing materials for a particular job, and that circumstances may dictate which material would be the best choice. For instance, the learners are required to say which material (corrugated iron or wood) would be best suited for a house located next to the ocean. They should be encouraged to think about aspects such as corrosion (which will be dealt with in greater detail later) and thermal conductivity (also covered later) which would make wood the better choice. Availability and cost are also aspects that could be brought into the conversation. How available is corrugated iron vs wood?</p>
</div>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>When we choose a material for a certain purpose, we look for a material with the right properties for the job. Look at the two pictures of houses below.</li>

<p>Metal objects usually rust in the wet, salty air close to the ocean. That would make a corrugated iron house a poor choice. Metals are also good conductors of heat, which would make the iron house cold inside when the outside temperature is cold, and hot inside when the weather is hot.</p>

<p>In this section learners will investigate and contrast the properties of metals and materials that are not metallic (so-called 'non-metals'). You could draw their attention to metallic and non-metallic items in the classroom, or in pictures, as an introduction to the topic and related activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Explanation of the new words to be covered in this section, associated with metals.</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Properties: The words we use to describe a certain type of matter, a material or even an object, e.g. a property of gases is that they can be compressed.</li>
<li>Metal: A shiny solid that can conduct heat or electricity and can be formed into sheets or wire.</li>
<li>Lustre/lustrous: The 'shine' we see when light reflects off the surface of a metallic object such as a key or a coin. We say that metals are 'lustrous'.</li>
<li>Dense: Dense materials have lots of particles packed close together. Less dense materials have fewer particles packed together. When we compare a metal teaspoon with a plastic teaspoon of the same size and shape, the metal teaspoon would be heavier, because metal is more dense than plastic. <strong>NB:</strong> Do not refer to dense objects as 'heavy' and less dense objects as 'light'. This creates a misconception that density is the same as mass. Density is the mass per unit volume. Mass does therefore influence density, but it is not the same as density. Rather explain it as how closely the particles in a substance is packed, which includes both mass and volume. The more particles that can fit into a specific size/shape, the more dense the object will be.</li>
<li>Malleable: Malleable materials can be hammered into different shapes without breaking. As a simple example you could think of bending a paper clip into a new shape.</li>
</ul></div>
<figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0002.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">So how can we tell if something is made of metal?</figcaption></figure><p>Good question Tom! Let's look at the properties of metals. A property is a word used to describe a material or object and tells us something about it.</p>

<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Metals are usually shiny. The shine that we see when light reflects off the surface of a metal is called the lustre of the metal.</li>
<li>Most metals are hard and they feel heavy.</li>
<li>We say metals are dense as their particles are packed close together.</li>
<li>Metals conduct electricity and heat well. (You will learn more about electricity next term. In Grade 6, you will learn about metals as conductors of electricity.)</li>
<li>Metals are malleable (they can be shaped into flat sheets) and they are ductile (this means they can be made into thin wire)</li>
<li>Most metals can be heated to high temperatures without melting or changing their shape, which is one of the reasons why pots and pans are made of metal. Can you think of any other reasons why pots and pans are made of metal?</li>
<li>Metals are mined from the Earth. You will learn more about this in another subject, Social Sciences.</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Here, the conversation could be directed in such a way that learners realise that when we cook food, we heat the <strong>outside</strong> of the pot, the food cooks on the <strong>inside</strong>. That means the heat that cooks the food travels through the metal. Would heat travel through plastic in the same way? No, the plastic would melt. Would heat travel through wood in the same way? No, the wood would burn.</p>
</div>
<figure><img src="img/loadingplaceholder.gif" width="300" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0003.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">Aaah! All these new words about metals! I still do not really know what they all mean!</figcaption></figure><p>Do not worry Tom! These are new, big words, but here is an activity in which we can investigate some of the properties of metals. We will use our skills of observation (looking, listening and touching) during the investigation.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Here, a comment about <strong>skills of observation</strong> may be appropriate. What are skills of observation? What does it mean to <strong>observe</strong> something? Does observation only refer to things we can see? No, we can also observe (hear) sounds, observe (smell) odours, observe (feel) textures and observe (taste) flavours. Learners might also find it difficult to express what they observe. Encourage them to find words to write down, or say what they see, hear, smell, feel and taste. This will help to develop their science vocabulary.</p>
</div>
<p>Remember when we looked at the two different houses made from tin and wood? Metals are used to make objects because of the properties that they have.</p>

<p>We have said that metals are shiny (they have lustre). But sometimes, when metal gets old it becomes dull. If something is dull, it has lost its shine. There are ways to make metals shiny again.</p>

<p>This activity is ideal for small group work. Learners could discuss their observations in the group and fill in the table of observations together.

<p>Why are some of the properties useful to the function of the pot. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Being strong and hard is useful as the pot needs to be able to carry food and you do not want it to break or shatter if you put it down hard on a surface. The metal conducts heat which is useful to cooking food (heat conductivity of metals is only meant to be introduced in the next chapter, but it can be mentioned here.) But the pot also will not melt as metals only melt at very high temperatures, much higher than the highest temperature the stove is able to reach.</p>

All these actions make it necessary for coins to be durable, so that they won't break easily. Coins are therefore made from metal.</p>

<p>What does the word "property" mean? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Properties are the things that are special about an object or a material. The properties of a material tells us what it is like.</p>

<p>How can we tell if something is made of metal? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Things that are made of metal is shiny, and hard and they can sometimes feel heavy.</p>

<p>What does it mean to 'use our skills of observation'? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Skills of observation are looking, listening and touching. Smelling and tasting are also forms of observation.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Design an investigation in which you are trying to work out whether an object is made of metal or a non-metal. You do not need to write out the materials and apparatus required. Rather, explain in a paragraph about the different types of tests you would do to determine if something is made of a metal or a non-metal. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Learners must use their experience from the investigations to explore the properties of metals and non-metals in this chapter, and from designing their own investigation with the Brasso and dull metals. They should explain some tests to do and the result from the test will say whether it is a metal or not. For example, they could drop the object on the floor to see if it is brittle or not (not all non-metals are brittle though), they could see whether the surface is dull (non-metal) or shiny (metal), they could see whether the object is strong and hard (metal) or soft and bendy (non-metal). But it is important to point out that you cannot just do one of these tests to make a conclusion as there will be some exceptions, such as plastic is hard and smooth like a metal, but it is brittle. So learners need to do more than one test to make a conclusion. This is explored further in the next question.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Sometimes, just using one property to classify an object or material as a metal or non-metal might not be enough. For example, plastic is flexible but strong, so does this make it a metal? The answer is no. Another example is glass. Glass is also hard, but is it strong? What other properties does glass have which make it a non-metal and not a metal? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
        
<p>Glass is not strong, as it is brittle and can crack and break easily. It does not have the lustre of metal, and it can't be hammered into flat sheets or made into thin wires (it is not malleable or ductile).</p>
