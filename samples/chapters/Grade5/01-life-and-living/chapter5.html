          <strong>Introducing this topic</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Play the song, Circle of Life, from the Disney classic, The Lion King. Discuss at length the words and meaning of this song as it pertains to our interdependence on each other and the circle of life that we are part of. It is available on: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX07j9SDFcc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX07j9SDFcc</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>This topic LIFE CYCLES has a very strong emphasis on the growth and development of plants and animals, to show that all living things need to grow and develop which is a theme carried through from Gr. 4. This textbook treats these topics therefore as a focus on GROWTH and DEVELOPMENT and not on individual plants and animals per se. Teachers are encouraged to follow a similar route to develop the underlying concepts and to draw learners' attention to the similarities between living organisms that grow and develop.</p>
        
        <p>Teachers are encouraged to display as many different reading materials, including books, posters, print-outs, etc. showing animal and plant life cycles, and to refer to these often during the course of this section.</p>

            <strong>Introducing this topic</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>Show learners a plant and the seed that it has grown from - if necessary buy a seedling from a nursery or grow your own seeds a few weeks before this lesson.</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Ask learners to describe how the seed changed from the seed-form to the plant-form and ask them to explain how the seed that seemed not to be living could come alive. (This is revision of Gr. 4 work on living and non-living things.)</li>
            <li>Remind them that under the right conditions something that seemed non-living can come alive again - the seed needed water and heat to come alive.</li>
            <li>Ask them whether the plant will stop growing once it has reached the present size and discuss their ideas about plant growth (a really good opportunity to assess existing knowledge of this topic.)</li>
          </ul></div>
        <p>Plants and animals grow and develop throughout their lives</p>
        <p>All plants and animals need to make new plants or they will become extinct (no longer exist on Earth). The adult plant or animal needs to reproduce offspring that will grow over time into a new adult that will reproduce offspring of its own. We call this a life cycle. It is a cycle because when a new plant or animal is made the cycle begins again.</p>
        
        <p>A plant or animal can die anywhere in its life cycle - at birth, as a young or old plant or animal. Let's take a closer look at the life cycle of flowering plants.</p>

                <div class="solution">
                  
                  <p>Teachers are encouraged to discuss this question with the class. Point out that new plants will be in competition with the parent plant for resources like water, soil, sunlight, etc and therefore the seeds need to go far away to find their own resources. Also, the parent plant wants to ensure the survival of the species and therefore sends seeds to different places in order to minimise the risk that all the seeds will be lost if something happens to them in one location.</p>

                  <p>Look at the pictures showing ways in which seeds are dispersed. Discuss these four ways and explain how you think the seeds are adapted in each method to be the most efficient. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div>
                <div class="solution">
                  
                  <p>The seeds dispersed by animals are either tasty so that birds and squirrels eat them, such as berries and nuts, or they have burrs so that they stick to the fur of animals. Seeds which are dispersed by the wind are light and have features which enable them to "fly" in the wind, such as wings. Seeds can be dispersed by explosion when the seed pods burst open and spray the seeds out. Seeds can be dispersed by water if the seeds drop into a river for example and are carried downstream. These seeds also need to be light and must float.</p>

          <p>About 5 - 6 weeks before this activity plant some cherry tomato seeds in a large container or in a sunny spot in the school garden. They grow very easily when given enough water and light and can provide the perfect example for this activity. Also, the learners can eat the cherry tomatoes that are harvested! Large tomatoes will take very long to ripen but can also work here. Remember to stake the tomato plants (for a VERY simple stake you can use any sort of stick, just stick it into the ground near the plant and tie the plant's biggest stems to this).</p>

            <p>
              NB: Tadpoles are VERY sensitive to chlorine and need fresh water regularly. Change the water REGULARLY (every day or two) by pouring half of the used water out and replacing it with fresh water. Do not add tap water directly to the remaining water. Boil the tap water and let it stand for 24 hrs before adding it to the tadpoles' water. Alternatively, buy de-chlorinating tablets but even then let the replacement water stand for 24 hrs before the water change. Here is an easy step-by-step guide to keeping tadpoles:<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://allaboutfrogs.org/info/tadpoles/"> http://allaboutfrogs.org/info/tadpoles/</a>

            <li>Growth and development</li>

            <li>Reproduction</li>
          </ul><p>The gestation stage in an animal's life is the time before the embryo (young animal) is bor Animals produce young in different ways:</p>
          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
              <strong>Born alive</strong>: some animals grow inside the womb of the mother animal and are then born alive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hatched from eggs:</strong> the mother animal lays eggs and the embryo develops inside the egg before it hatches.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hatched from eggs inside the mother animal's body and are then born alive:</strong> the embryo develops within an egg inside the mother animal's body. The eggs can hatch just before or just after birth.
            </li>
          </ul><figure><a class="lightbox" href="images/gd-0129.jpg"><img src="../../img/loadingplaceholder.gif" class="lazy" data-original="images/gd-0129.jpg"/></a><noscript><img src="images/gd-0129.jpg" width="300"/></noscript><figcaption class="caption">Gestation - in a human the baby grows in the mother's womb and is then born. In a chicken, the mother lays an egg and the embryo develops in the egg before hatching.</figcaption></figure><p>After the animal is born or hatched, they grow and change.</p>
          
          <p>Some animals undergo a simple change. Puppies, for example, look similar to adult dogs.</p>

            Other animals (mostly amphibians and insects) look very different to the adult animal when they hatch. They go through very big changes in their life cycles. This change is called a <strong>metamorphosis</strong>. Look at the stages of metamorphosis of a monarch butterfly below.

              <p>Fruit-flies can smell ripe fruit and come from a long distance to find it. The females lay eggs on the fruit. When the eggs of the fruit-fly hatches, little worms like larvae hatch. The larvae eats as much as it can and grows quickly. It turns into a pupa. The pupa has a hard case or chrysalis. Inside the chrysalis the pupa undergoes tremendous changes. After four days, the case breaks open and a fly with wings comes out. The activity might not work and you might not get fruit flies hatching. In that case, explain to the learners that the flies did not smell the fruit and did not come. Refer to the diagram below to continue the activity.</p>
