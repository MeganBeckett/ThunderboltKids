<p><strong>Introducing the topic</strong></p>

<p>In this unit, the learners will find out about what all living things have in common. The emphasis must not be on memorising facts or definitions but on activities that use process skills such as: <strong>observing differences, sorting and classifying, describing and drawing.</strong> As a teacher, you need to build the language needed for talking about concepts. Even if the learners use the <strong>correct word</strong>, the <strong>meanings</strong> of that word may be different for each of them. It is especially important to introduce the formal scientific terms of the seven life processes correctly and to explain each process and word-meaning accurately.</p>

<p>Although more technical terms may be introduced incidentally, CAPS requires that the seven life processes are named as follows: moving, reproducing, sensing, feeding, breathing, excreting and growth. Learners need to understand the seven life processes and distinguishing between living and non-living things. It is suggested that teachers make a display with these words: cut coloured A4 pages lengthwise in half, write or print the process on each long strip and use prestik to attach it to the wall in a mind-map formation. In the centre of the mind-map write: "The Seven Life Processes". As examples of each of these processes are studied in the class let the learners add illustrations or interesting facts and build the mind-map as you work through the section.</p>

<p>It is ok if you do not agree with everyone else! It is important that you listen to everyone when they explain what they think it means to be living or non-living.</p>
</div>
<p>It is not always easy to say if something is living or non-living. Many times things that look as if they are non-living can become alive again. Other things like a river or soil, are non-living but people say that the "soil is alive" or talk of the "living waters". This is because there are so many living things that live in the soil or the water. This can be a bit confusing, don't you think?</p>

<p>Look carefully at the living things in the photos. Can you see what is the same in ALL of them? Something that they maybe all DO?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide"><ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Introduce the unit with a class discussion.

<li>Discuss the difference in terminology between something that is non-living and something that is dead.</li>
<li>Suggested questions:

<li>Are all living things animals? What do plants and animals need to stay alive? (Water, food, air etc.)</li>
<li>Which seven things do have all living things have in common?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>Let the learners examine the photos to identify the seven life processes. Let them explain each in their own words. Encourage learners to work out an acronym to remember the seven life processes.  For example:</p>

<p>M = Movement</p>

<p>R =  Reproducing</p>

<p>S = Sensing</p>

<p>B= Breathing</p>

<p>F = Feeding</p>

<p>E = Excreting</p>

<p>All seven of the life processes must happen for something to be living. If something does not carry out all seven life processes then it is non-living. For example, if you think of a river, you may think it moves and grows, but a river does not sense or feed or excrete or breathe or reproduce so it is non-living!</p>

<p>Great Farrah! Yes, some things seem to be non-living for a very long time. They wait until they sense the right conditions to revive again. This means that they have to wait for something special to happen before they can revive and show the characteristics of living things. We say they need the right conditions to revive and show the seven life processes. Look at the pictures below of seeds which seem to be non-living!</p>

<p>Why do seeds seem to be non-living? How can we show that they are living?</p>

            </div><div class="solution">
          
<p>Learners might think seeds are non-living as they do not appear to show any of the 7 life processes. But things can appear to be non-living when they are actually in a dormant state. You can germinate the seeds to show that they are living.</p>

            </div></div></div></div>
</div>

<p>We say the seeds are in a "dormant state" until they are given water, warmth, air, light and soil to germinate and start growing. There are other things too which seem to be non-living, but if they are given the right conditions then they can revive and carry on living.</p>

<p>Yeast can cause bread dough or cake batter to raise. Yeast needs warmth to come alive and start raising the bread. Some people buy dry yeast for their baking. Dry yeast needs moisture, heat and sugar to start working. That is why you will see bakers place their dough in a warm place (near the stove for example) to get it to rise.</p>

            </div><div class="solution">
          
<p>She needs to keep the eggs warm in order to hatch them.</p>

            </div></div></div></div>
</li>
<li><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Farmers often do not let the mother chickens sit on their eggs. Instead they put the eggs in something called an incubator, as you see in the picture above of the chicken eggs hatching. What does the incubator provide to the eggs? \answerline{2}
            </div><div class="solution">
          
<p>It provides warmth.</p>

            </div></div></div></div>
</li>
<li><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">A snake normally lays her eggs in a 'nest'. Why does she not have to lie on top of them to hatch them? \answerline{2}
            </div><div class="solution">
          
<p>Snakes are cold-blooded, so even if the snake did lie on top of the eggs (like birds do) it would not help them hatch as her body would not provide any heat. The heat of the sun provides the warmth to hatch the eggs.</p>

            </div></div></div></div>
</li>
<li><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Have you ever caught tadpoles or kept silkworms in a box? Maybe someone in your class has some that they can bring to school. In what season can you normally find little tadpoles or silkworms, and why? \answerline{3}
            </div><div class="solution">
          
<p>Silkworms are typically available in spring and early summer, and tadpoles can generally be found in pools and ponds from spring to autumn. The eggs need warmth to hatch. The adult animals lay their eggs in these seasons because the warmth of the sun will hatch the eggs.</p>

<p>Read the following story and then answer the questions that follow.</p>

<p><strong>The Strelitzias</strong></p>

<p>When the world was made, the Strelitzia birds were among the finest of all the animals created! Their bright orange feathers and dark purple wings adorned the sky and all the other animals admired their beauty. They would glide for hours, high in the sky and only came down to feed at the river bed. They would tell the other animals of all the wonderful things they had seen from high in the sky.</p>

<p>They made their nests in the highest cliffs. They almost never sat in the trees or walked on the ground among the other animals. As time went by, the Strelitzia birds became proud and arrogant. They started to look down on the other animals and teased them endlessly They told the tall giraffe that her neck would never know cool breezes they have felt. They laughed at the tortoise who would always have to walk through the dust, rocks and sand. They sneered at the crocodile who always had to be near the water and mocked the monkeys for being stuck in the trees.</p>

<p>One day the Maker came to visit the animals. Instead of the beautiful, joyous creation he had intended, he saw only sadness and tears. One by one, the animals told him how the Strelitzia birds had teased and taunted them all. The Maker became very upset at how arrogant these beautiful birds had become.</p>

<p>The Maker snatched from the sky, one by one, and stuck their strong, slender legs deep into the soil. Their graceful long toes became roots and their feathers and wings turned to dull green leaves. Only their crowning plumes of orange and purple remained as a reminder of their lost beauty.</p>

<p>If you find a Strelitzia flower today, look carefully and you will see how they are still reaching for the sky, trying to free their feet from the soil so they can fly again.</p>
